# Assembly Guide

This page walks through the process of assembling your workbook using AI-generated content.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Generate Content
Use AI to draft the text for each page, providing your mission context, learning goals, and role descriptions as input.

### 2. Review and Revise
Check every page against these criteria:
- Does it align to a learning goal?
- Is the language appropriate for your grade level?
- Are instructions clear and actionable?
- Is there enough space for student work?

### 3. Format and Layout
Apply consistent formatting:
- Page numbers on every page
- Mission title in header or footer
- Consistent font sizes (title, body, caption)
- Team name and role fields where relevant

### 4. Test with Students
Before full deployment:
- Have a colleague review for clarity
- Pilot with a small group of students
- Note where students get confused or stuck
- Revise based on feedback
