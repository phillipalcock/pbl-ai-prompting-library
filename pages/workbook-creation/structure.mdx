# Workbook Structure

The standard PBL workbook follows an 18-page structure. Each page has a specific purpose in guiding students through the mission.

## The 18-Page Framework

| Page | Title | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Cover Page | Mission title, team info, visual identity |
| 2 | Mission Brief | Driving question, context, overview |
| 3 | Learning Goals | What students will know and be able to do |
| 4 | Team Roles | Role descriptions and assignments |
| 5 | Project Timeline | Schedule with checkpoints and deadlines |
| 6 | Research Guide | Sources, methods, and note-taking space |
| 7-8 | Investigation Pages | Guided inquiry activities |
| 9-10 | Data Collection | Templates for gathering evidence |
| 11-12 | Analysis Pages | Frameworks for interpreting findings |
| 13 | Draft Planning | Outline for the final product |
| 14-15 | Production Pages | Space for creating the deliverable |
| 16 | Peer Review | Structured feedback protocols |
| 17 | Reflection | Self-assessment and learning review |
| 18 | Presentation Guide | Tips for the public presentation |

## Design Principles

- Every page connects to at least one learning goal
- Instructions use student-facing language (not teacher notes)
- White space is intentional — students need room to work
- Visual hierarchy guides students through each page
