## What's Included

The worksheet guides you through transforming each curriculum standard into actionable learning objectives:

### Step 1: Standard Deconstruction
Break down the standard into its component parts:
- **Content** — What knowledge is required?
- **Skills** — What processes or procedures are described?
- **Cognitive level** — What type of thinking is expected?
- **Context clues** — What real-world applications are implied?

### Step 2: Tier Mapping
Assign the deconstructed elements to the four tiers:

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Tier</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Question to Ask</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Source in Standard</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Tier 1: Content Knowledge</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>What do students need to know?</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Nouns and concepts in the standard</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Tier 2: Skills and Processes</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>What do students need to do?</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Verbs and procedures in the standard</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Tier 3: Critical Thinking</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>How do students need to think?</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Higher-order verbs (analyze, evaluate, synthesize)</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Tier 4: Communication</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>How do students share their learning?</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Often implied, not explicit — add based on your PBL design</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

### Step 3: Objective Writing
Transform each tier element into a measurable "Students will..." statement.

### Step 4: Alignment Verification
Check that each objective:
- Uses a measurable verb
- Specifies observable student behavior
- Connects clearly to the original standard
- Can be assessed within the project

## How to Use

1. Select 2-4 curriculum standards for your PBL mission
2. Deconstruct each standard into content, skills, and cognitive level
3. Map elements to the four tiers
4. Write measurable objectives for each tier
5. Verify alignment and assessability
