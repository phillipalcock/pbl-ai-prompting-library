## What's Included

This template walks you through building a rubric from scratch:

1. **Identify Criteria** — Derive assessment criteria directly from your learning objectives
2. **Define Performance Levels** — Establish clear levels (e.g., Exceeds, Meets, Approaching, Beginning)
3. **Write Descriptors** — Create specific, observable descriptions for each level
4. **Review and Refine** — Check for clarity, consistency, and alignment

## Step 1: Identify Criteria from Objectives

For each learning objective, ask:
- What does successful performance look like?
- What are the key components or dimensions of quality?
- What would distinguish strong work from weak work?

Each criterion should be a single, assessable dimension of the work (e.g., "Use of Evidence," "Organization," "Scientific Accuracy").

## Step 2: Define Performance Levels

Choose a scale that fits your needs:

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Scale</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Levels</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Best For</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>4-point</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Exceeds / Meets / Approaching / Beginning</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Most assignments and projects</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>3-point</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Proficient / Developing / Emerging</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Formative assessments, quick checks</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Single-point</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Criteria with space for feedback above and below</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Feedback-focused assessments</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

## Step 3: Write Descriptors

Each cell in the rubric should describe specific, observable qualities. Avoid vague language like "good" or "needs improvement."

**Strong descriptor example:**
> "Cites at least three relevant sources with proper formatting and integrates evidence smoothly into the argument."

**Weak descriptor example:**
> "Good use of sources."

## Sample Rubric Preview

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Criterion</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Exceeds (4)</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Meets (3)</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Approaching (2)</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Beginning (1)</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Use of Evidence</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Cites 3+ relevant sources; evidence is well-integrated and strongly supports the argument</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Cites 2-3 relevant sources; evidence supports the argument</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Cites 1-2 sources; evidence is present but loosely connected to the argument</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Sources missing or not relevant; evidence does not support the argument</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Organization</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Logical structure with smooth transitions; reader can easily follow the reasoning</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Clear structure with adequate transitions between ideas</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Some organizational structure present but transitions are weak or missing</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>No clear organizational structure; ideas are difficult to follow</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Scientific Accuracy</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>All scientific concepts are accurate and applied correctly with depth</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Scientific concepts are mostly accurate with minor errors</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Some scientific concepts are inaccurate or applied incorrectly</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Major scientific inaccuracies or concepts are missing</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

## AI Prompt for Rubric Generation

Use this prompt template to generate a draft rubric with AI:

> I need a rubric for the following assignment: [describe assignment].
>
> The learning objectives are:
> - [Objective 1]
> - [Objective 2]
> - [Objective 3]
>
> Please create a 4-point rubric with criteria derived from these objectives. For each criterion, write specific, observable descriptors at each performance level (Exceeds, Meets, Approaching, Beginning). Avoid vague language.

## How to Use

1. Start with your learning objectives for the assignment
2. Identify 3-5 criteria that capture the key dimensions of quality
3. Choose your performance level scale
4. Write descriptors for each criterion at each level
5. Review the rubric for clarity and share with students before the assignment
6. Use AI to generate a draft, then revise with your professional judgment

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Share rubrics with students before they begin an assignment. When students understand the criteria and performance levels, they can self-assess and aim for higher quality work.
