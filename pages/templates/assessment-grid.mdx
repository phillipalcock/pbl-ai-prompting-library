# Assessment Alignment Grid

<TemplateCard
  title="Assessment Alignment Grid"
  description="A tracking tool that maps every standard to its learning goal, assessment method, and location in the project. Ensures nothing falls through the cracks."
  badge="Planning Tool"
  downloadHref="/templates/assessment-alignment-grid.pdf"
>
  <Text size="sm" c="dimmed">Use alongside Module 5: Assessment</Text>
</TemplateCard>

## What's Included

The grid tracks four alignment points for every standard:

1. **Standard** — The curriculum standard being addressed
2. **Learning Goal** — The specific objective (with tier)
3. **Assessment Method** — How you'll measure it
4. **Project Location** — Where in the project it's assessed

## Gap Analysis Section

The template includes a gap analysis checklist:

- [ ] Every standard has at least one learning goal
- [ ] Every learning goal has an assessment method
- [ ] Every assessment method has a location in the project
- [ ] Assessment methods match the cognitive level of the goal (Tier 3 goals need more than recall-level assessment)
- [ ] Students have instruction and scaffolding for each goal before assessment

## How to Use

1. List all standards you're addressing in the first column
2. Write the corresponding learning goal and tier for each standard
3. Identify how each goal will be assessed
4. Locate where in the project (checkpoint, page, presentation) the assessment occurs
5. Run the gap analysis and fill any holes

<Callout type="info" title="AI assistance">
Use the alignment review AI prompt from Module 5 to check your completed grid. Paste the grid contents and ask the AI to identify any gaps, misalignments, or cognitive-level mismatches.
