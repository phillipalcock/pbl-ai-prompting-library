# Assessment Alignment Grid

<TemplateCard
  title="Assessment Alignment Grid"
  description="A tracking tool that maps every standard to its learning objective, assessment method, and location in the unit. Ensures nothing falls through the cracks."
  badge="Planning Tool"
  downloadHref="/templates/assessment-alignment-grid.pdf"
>
  <Text size="sm" c="dimmed">Use alongside your unit planning process</Text>
</TemplateCard>

## What's Included

The grid tracks four alignment points for every standard:

1. **Standard** — The curriculum standard being addressed
2. **Learning Objective** — The specific measurable objective
3. **Assessment Method** — How you will measure it
4. **Unit Location** — Where in the unit it is assessed

## Gap Analysis Section

The template includes a gap analysis checklist:

- [ ] Every standard has at least one learning objective
- [ ] Every learning objective has an assessment method
- [ ] Every assessment method has a location in the unit
- [ ] Assessment methods match the cognitive level of the objective (higher-order objectives need more than recall-level assessment)
- [ ] Students receive instruction and scaffolding for each objective before assessment

## How to Use

1. List all standards you are addressing in the first column
2. Write the corresponding learning objective for each standard
3. Identify how each objective will be assessed
4. Locate where in the unit (lesson, activity, or assessment point) the assessment occurs
5. Run the gap analysis and fill any holes

Use an AI prompt to check your completed grid. Paste the grid contents and ask the AI to identify any gaps, misalignments, or cognitive-level mismatches between objectives and assessment methods.
