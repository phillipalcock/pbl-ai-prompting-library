# AI-Generated Graphics

AI image tools can create custom illustrations for your educational materials.

## When to Use AI Graphics

Good uses:
- Cover page illustrations matching your unit theme
- Icons representing student roles
- Diagrams of processes or systems
- Decorative elements that reinforce context

Avoid using AI graphics for:
- Photographs that need to represent real people accurately
- Data visualizations (create these manually with real data)
- Anything requiring text within the image (AI text generation is unreliable)

## Prompting for Educational Graphics

Structure your image prompts:

```
Create a [style] illustration of [subject].
Style: clean, professional, suitable for [grade level] educational materials.
Color palette: [specify colors that match your materials].
Do not include any text in the image.
```

## Example Prompts

**For an environmental science unit:**
"Clean line illustration of a river ecosystem showing water flow, vegetation, and wildlife. Professional educational style. Blue and green color palette. No text."

**For a community data project:**
"Flat design illustration of diverse people analyzing charts and graphs in a community meeting space. Warm, inviting colors. Professional educational style. No text."

## Image Formats

- Save graphics as PNG for print materials
- Use SVG for web-based materials
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB per image)
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios across your materials
