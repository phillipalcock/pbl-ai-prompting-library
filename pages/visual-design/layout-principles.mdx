# Layout Principles

Good layout makes your workbook easier to use. These principles apply whether you're designing in Google Docs, Canva, or any other tool.

## Core Principles

### Hierarchy
Use size, weight, and spacing to show what's most important:
- Page title: largest, boldest
- Section headers: medium size
- Body text: standard size
- Captions and notes: smaller

### Consistency
Every page should feel like part of the same document:
- Same fonts throughout
- Same margin sizes
- Same header/footer format
- Same color scheme

### White Space
Resist the urge to fill every inch of the page. White space:
- Makes pages less overwhelming
- Gives students room to write
- Improves readability
- Creates visual breathing room

### Alignment
Align elements to a grid:
- Left-align body text (don't justify)
- Center titles if appropriate
- Keep margins consistent
- Align related elements to each other

## Page Layout Template

A standard workbook page should have:
- 1-inch margins on all sides
- Page title at top
- 2-3 content sections with clear headers
- Response area taking at least 40% of the page
- Page number at bottom
