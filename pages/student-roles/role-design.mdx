# Designing Roles

Student roles in PBL should feel real. They mirror positions that exist in the professional world related to your project context.

## What Makes a Good Role

A strong student role:

- **Has a real-world counterpart** — It exists outside the classroom
- **Carries specific responsibilities** — The student knows exactly what they own
- **Requires the target skills** — Fulfilling the role develops the learning goals
- **Contributes to the team** — Each role is necessary for project success

## Role Design Process

1. Identify the real-world context of your mission
2. Research what professionals actually do in that context
3. Select 4-5 roles that cover the project's needs
4. Define each role's responsibilities and deliverables
5. Map roles to learning goals

## Example Role Set: Environmental Impact Study

| Community Liaison | Outreach Coordinator | Stakeholder interviews and input |
