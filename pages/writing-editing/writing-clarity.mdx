# Writing for Clarity

Clear writing is the foundation of effective curriculum materials. When instructions are ambiguous or language is overcomplicated, students lose time figuring out what you mean instead of learning.

This page covers practical techniques for writing educational content that communicates on the first read.

## Plain Language Principles

Plain language does not mean dumbed-down language. It means choosing the most direct way to say something so readers understand it quickly.

**Core principles:**

- Use short sentences for instructions (aim for 15-20 words per sentence)
- Choose common words over formal alternatives ("use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate")
- Put the most important information first
- Use active voice so the reader knows who does what
- Define technical terms when you introduce them

<Alert variant="light" color="blue" title="Plain language is not the same as simple content" my="md">
  You can teach complex ideas in plain language. The goal is to remove unnecessary barriers between the reader and the content, not to reduce the complexity of the ideas themselves.
</Alert>

## Structuring Instructions for Clarity

The way you organize instructions matters as much as the words you choose.

<Tabs defaultValue="sequencing" my="md">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Tab value="sequencing">Sequencing</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab value="chunking">Chunking</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab value="signposting">Signposting</Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs.List>

  <Tabs.Panel value="sequencing" pt="md">
    ### Use Logical Sequencing

    Present steps in the order students should complete them. Avoid burying prerequisites at the end.

    | Unclear | Clear |
    |---------|-------|
    | Write your analysis (make sure you have completed the data table first). | 1. Complete the data table. 2. Review your results. 3. Write your analysis. |
    | Discuss with your group after reading pages 4-6 and answering the questions. | 1. Read pages 4-6. 2. Answer the questions on this page. 3. Discuss your answers with your group. |
  </Tabs.Panel>

  <Tabs.Panel value="chunking" pt="md">
    ### Break Content into Chunks

    Group related information together under clear headings. Each section should address one idea or task.

    **Effective chunking strategies:**
    - One instruction per numbered step
    - One concept per paragraph
    - One topic per page or section
    - Use bullet lists for sets of related items
    - Use numbered lists for sequential steps
  </Tabs.Panel>

  <Tabs.Panel value="signposting" pt="md">
    ### Use Signposting

    Tell readers what is coming, what they are doing now, and what comes next.

    **Examples of signposts:**
    - "In this section, you will..."
    - "Before you begin, make sure you have..."
    - "Next, you will use your results to..."
    - "By the end of this activity, you should be able to..."

    Signposts reduce cognitive load by letting readers focus on the content instead of figuring out the structure.

## Writing for Different Audiences

Educational materials often serve multiple audiences. Adjust your language and level of detail accordingly.

## Avoiding Common Clarity Pitfalls

### Ambiguity

Ambiguous instructions leave students guessing. Be specific about quantity, format, and expectations.

| Ambiguous | Clear |
|-----------|-------|
| Write about the topic | Write a 4-5 sentence paragraph explaining how photosynthesis converts sunlight into energy |
| Research your subject | Find 3 sources about your subject. For each, record the title, author, and one key finding |
| Analyze the results | Calculate the mean and range. Then write 2 sentences describing what the numbers tell you |

### Passive Voice

Passive voice hides who is responsible for the action. In instructions, this creates confusion.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| The data should be recorded in the table | Record your data in the table |
| The essay will be evaluated on clarity | I will evaluate your essay on clarity |
| The experiment must be completed by Friday | Complete the experiment by Friday |

### Jargon

Every field has jargon. In curriculum materials, the question is whether the jargon serves the learner or creates a barrier.

**When to use technical terms:**
- The term itself is a learning objective (students need to learn the word)
- No simpler alternative exists without losing precision

**When to avoid or define terms:**
- The term is field shorthand that students do not need ("scaffolding," "formative assessment" in student materials)
- A common word works just as well
- The audience is parents or community members
