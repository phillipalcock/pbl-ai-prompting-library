# Student-Facing Language

PBL workbooks are written for students, not teachers. The language should be direct, clear, and actionable.

## Principles

### Write to the Student
Use "you" and "your team." Avoid third-person references like "students will" — that's for lesson plans, not workbooks.

| Teacher-Facing | Student-Facing |
|---------------|----------------|
| Students will analyze data | Analyze your data using the table below |
| The objective is to... | In this section, you will... |
| Assessment will measure... | You'll be evaluated on... |

### Be Direct
Use imperative sentences for instructions:
- "Read the article and highlight three key claims."
- "Record your observations in the table."
- "Discuss your findings with your team."

### Match the Grade Level
Use vocabulary appropriate to your students. When technical terms are necessary, define them in context.

### Be Specific
Vague instructions cause confusion:

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Research your topic | Find 3 sources about [topic]. For each, record the title, author, key finding, and how it relates to your driving question. |
| Analyze the data | Calculate the mean and range for each data set. Create a bar graph comparing the three locations. |
| Reflect on your learning | Write 3-4 sentences answering: What did you learn that surprised you? How did your thinking change? |
