# Editing AI Outputs

AI can draft educational content quickly, but every output requires human review and editing. AI-generated text often sounds competent at first glance while containing issues that undermine its usefulness in a classroom setting.

This page provides a structured approach to reviewing, revising, and improving AI-generated curriculum materials.

## Common AI Writing Issues

Before you can fix problems, you need to know what to look for. These are the most frequent issues in AI-generated educational content.

## A Structured Review Process

Do not try to catch everything in a single read. Use multiple passes, each focused on a specific dimension.

<Tabs defaultValue="accuracy" my="md">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Tab value="accuracy">1. Accuracy</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab value="tone">2. Tone</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab value="specificity">3. Specificity</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab value="alignment">4. Alignment</Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs.List>

  <Tabs.Panel value="accuracy" pt="md">
    ### Pass 1: Accuracy Check

    Focus only on whether the content is factually correct.

    - Verify every statistic, date, name, and citation
    - Confirm that standards references (CCSS, NGSS, etc.) are accurate
    - Check that described processes or methods are correct
    - Ensure examples are realistic and factually sound
    - Look for fabricated sources or references

    **How to verify:** Cross-reference claims against official sources. If you cannot verify a fact, remove it or replace it with one you can confirm.
  </Tabs.Panel>

  <Tabs.Panel value="tone" pt="md">
    ### Pass 2: Tone Check

    Focus on whether the voice is consistent and appropriate for the audience.

    - Read the document aloud (or use text-to-speech) to hear tone shifts
    - Confirm the entire document addresses the same audience
    - Check for overly formal or overly casual sections
    - Remove filler enthusiasm ("Great job!" "How exciting!") unless it serves a purpose
    - Ensure the tone matches your school or program's communication style

    **Quick test:** Could the same person have written every paragraph? If not, revise for consistency.
  </Tabs.Panel>

  <Tabs.Panel value="specificity" pt="md">
    ### Pass 3: Specificity Check

    Focus on whether the content is concrete enough to be useful.

    - Replace every generic instruction with a specific one
    - Fill in all placeholder text with real content
    - Ensure students know exactly what to do, how much to produce, and in what format
    - Add context that is specific to your school, community, or subject
    - Remove vague qualifiers ("various," "several," "some")

    **Quick test:** Could a substitute teacher use these materials without additional explanation? If not, add detail.
  </Tabs.Panel>

  <Tabs.Panel value="alignment" pt="md">
    ### Pass 4: Alignment Check

    Focus on whether every piece of content serves the stated learning goals.

    - Confirm each activity connects to a specific learning objective
    - Check that assessment criteria match what was taught
    - Verify that the sequence builds logically toward the final goal
    - Remove content that is interesting but does not serve the objectives
    - Ensure time allocations are realistic for each activity

    **Quick test:** For every section, can you answer "What learning goal does this serve?" If not, cut it or revise it.
  </Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs>

## Giving AI Revision Instructions

When AI output needs improvement, the quality of your revision prompt determines the quality of the result. Be specific about what is wrong and what you want instead.

### Weak vs. Strong Revision Prompts

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| Make this better | Rewrite paragraph 2 to use active voice and address students directly using "you" |
| This is too generic | Replace the three generic examples with examples about [specific topic from our unit] |
| Fix the tone | The tone shifts in sections 3 and 5. Rewrite them to match the direct, second-person style used in sections 1 and 2 |
| Make it more specific | The instructions in step 4 are vague. Rewrite to tell students exactly how many sources to find, what to record for each, and what format to use |

### Revision Prompt Templates

**For specificity:**
```
The following section is too generic. Rewrite it with these specific details:
- Subject: [your subject]
- Grade level: [grade]
- Specific topic: [topic]
- Context: [any relevant details about your students or school]

[paste the section]
```

**For tone correction:**
```
Rewrite the following to maintain a consistent [describe tone: direct and student-facing / professional and teacher-facing / warm and parent-friendly] tone throughout.
Do not use [list phrases to avoid].
Here is an example of the tone I want: [paste a sentence or paragraph that has the right tone].

[paste the section that needs revision]
```

**For removing AI patterns:**
```
Rewrite the following to sound more natural and varied.
- Do not start consecutive paragraphs with the same word
- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)
- Remove filler transitions like "Additionally," "Furthermore," and "Moreover"
- Do not use the words "comprehensive," "robust," or "meaningful"

[paste the content]
```

## Key Takeaways

- AI-generated content always requires human editing. Treat every AI output as a first draft.
- Use multiple review passes, each focused on one dimension (accuracy, tone, specificity, alignment).
- When asking AI to revise, be specific about what is wrong and what you want instead.
- The most common issue is generic language. Replace vague phrasing with concrete details from your actual teaching context.
- Verify every factual claim. AI confidence is not the same as AI accuracy.
