# Effective Prompting Principles

These six principles are the foundation for writing prompts that produce useful, standards-aligned educational content. They apply to every workflow in this course.

## 1. Be Specific About Context

Every educational prompt should include the context that a skilled colleague would need to do the work. At minimum, specify:

- **Grade level** — "3rd grade" not "elementary"
- **Subject and topic** — "7th grade life science, cell organelles" not "science"
- **Standards** — Include the specific standard codes and text when possible
- **Student population details** — English learners, advanced learners, or specific needs when relevant

**Weak prompt:**
> Write a lesson about fractions.

**Strong prompt:**
> Write a lesson for 4th grade math on comparing fractions with unlike denominators, aligned to CCSS 4.NF.A.2. The class includes 6 English learners at WIDA level 3 and 4 students with IEPs requiring extended time.

The strong prompt gives AI enough information to generate something you can actually use. The weak prompt produces generic content that requires extensive revision.

## 2. Structure Prompts With Role, Context, Task, Format, and Constraints

Consistent prompt structure produces consistent output quality. Use these five components:

- **Role** — Tell the AI what expertise to draw on ("You are an experienced 8th grade ELA teacher...")
- **Context** — Provide the background situation ("We are in week 3 of a unit on argumentative writing...")
- **Task** — State exactly what you want produced ("Create a formative assessment...")
- **Format** — Specify the output structure ("Use a table with columns for standard, question, and DOK level...")
- **Constraints** — Set boundaries ("Limit to 10 questions. All questions must be answerable using only the provided text. Do not exceed DOK level 3.")

You do not need all five components in every prompt, but including more of them produces more targeted results. For complex materials, use all five.

**Example using all five components:**
> **Role:** You are a curriculum specialist with expertise in backward design and NGSS alignment.
>
> **Context:** I am designing a 5th grade science unit on ecosystems. Students have already learned about food chains and will next study human impact on environments.
>
> **Task:** Generate a performance task where students analyze data about a local ecosystem and propose an evidence-based conservation plan.
>
> **Format:** Include: task description (1 paragraph), student-facing directions (numbered steps), a scoring rubric (4-point scale), and a list of aligned NGSS standards.
>
> **Constraints:** The task must be completable in two 45-minute class periods. Reading level should not exceed Lexile 850. All data should be realistic but simplified for 5th graders.

## 3. Iterate On Outputs

Your first prompt rarely produces your final product. Plan for at least two rounds of revision:

1. **Generate** — Run your initial prompt and review the output
2. **Refine** — Ask for specific changes ("Make question 3 higher DOK level," "Rewrite the rubric in student-friendly language," "Add sentence starters for English learners")
3. **Polish** — Make final adjustments by hand or with targeted follow-up prompts

Iteration is faster than trying to write the perfect prompt on the first attempt. Treat the first output as a draft, not a deliverable.

**Common iteration moves:**
- "Increase the rigor of questions 2 and 5"
- "Rewrite this at a Lexile level of 600"
- "Add scaffolding for students who struggle with [specific skill]"
- "Make this more culturally responsive by including contexts relevant to [community]"
- "Reformat this as a student-facing handout"

## 4. Provide Examples In Prompts

When you need output in a specific style or format, include an example. AI produces significantly better results when it can pattern-match against a concrete model.

**Without example:**
> Write a driving question for a 6th grade social studies unit on government.

**With example:**
> Write a driving question for a 6th grade social studies unit on government. Here is an example of the style I want: "Our city is redesigning its public parks — how should we decide what the community actually needs?" The question should be open-ended, connected to a real-world scenario, and accessible to 6th graders.

Providing one or two examples is usually sufficient. If your examples are strong, the AI will match their tone, length, complexity, and structure.

## 5. Avoid Common Prompting Mistakes

These mistakes account for most low-quality AI outputs in curriculum design:

- **Being too vague** — "Make it good" or "Make it rigorous" without defining what that means. Instead, specify: "All questions should be DOK level 3 or higher, requiring students to analyze or evaluate."
- **Asking for too much at once** — A prompt that requests an entire unit plan with all materials will produce shallow content. Break it into focused requests: standards analysis, then objectives, then assessment, then individual lessons.
- **Not specifying format** — If you do not tell AI how to structure the output, you will spend time reformatting. Ask for tables, numbered lists, headers, or whatever format you actually need.
- **Accepting first output without review** — Always read AI output critically. Check for factual accuracy, standards alignment, appropriate difficulty, and cultural sensitivity.
- **Forgetting to include standards** — Without specific standards, AI generates content that is topically relevant but not necessarily aligned to what students need to learn.
- **Using jargon without definition** — Terms like "rigorous," "engaging," or "differentiated" mean different things to different educators. Define what you mean or provide examples.

## 6. Design for Equity From the Start

Include equity considerations in your prompts rather than treating them as afterthoughts:

- Specify the linguistic backgrounds of your students
- Request multiple entry points for different skill levels
- Ask for culturally responsive contexts and examples
- Include accessibility requirements (reading level, visual supports, simplified language)
- Request materials in formats that work for all learners

**Example:**
> Create a set of 8 discussion questions for a 10th grade English class reading "The House on Mango Street." The class includes students reading at Lexile levels from 700 to 1100. Provide each question at two complexity levels: an access-level version and an extension-level version. Include sentence starters for the access-level questions.

## Applying These Principles

These six principles will surface in every workflow throughout this course. When you encounter a prompt template in later modules, you will see these principles embedded in the structure. When you write your own prompts, use these principles as your checklist.
