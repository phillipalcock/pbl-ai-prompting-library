# The Curriculum Design Cycle

Effective AI-assisted curriculum design follows a structured cycle. This page provides a concise overview of that cycle and how AI supports each stage.

## Backward Design

The curriculum design cycle used throughout this course is grounded in backward design, the framework developed by Wiggins and McTighe in *Understanding by Design*. The core idea is simple: start with what students need to learn, then design assessments that prove they learned it, and only then plan the instruction and materials.

This matters for AI-assisted design because AI does not think backward. If you prompt AI with "create a fun lesson about volcanoes," it will start with activities and work forward. The result may be engaging but poorly aligned. When you prompt AI within a backward design framework — starting with standards and assessment evidence — the output is both engaging and purposeful.

## The Six Stages

The curriculum design cycle has six stages. Each stage builds on the one before it, and AI plays a different role at each point.

| Stage | What You Do | How AI Helps |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **1. Analyze Standards** | Identify the standards for the unit. Unpack what students must know and be able to do. | AI can break down standard language, identify prerequisite skills, and flag cross-curricular connections. |
| **2. Define Objectives** | Write clear, measurable learning objectives derived from the standards. | AI drafts objectives using stems like "Students will be able to..." and aligns them to DOK levels. |
| **3. Plan Assessment** | Design assessments that directly measure the objectives. Determine what counts as evidence of learning. | AI generates assessment items, rubrics, and performance task descriptions aligned to your objectives. |
| **4. Design Instruction** | Plan the sequence of lessons, activities, and learning experiences that prepare students for the assessment. | AI creates lesson outlines, discussion questions, practice activities, and scaffolded learning sequences. |
| **5. Create Materials** | Develop the actual student-facing and teacher-facing documents needed for implementation. | AI drafts handouts, slides, reading passages, graphic organizers, and other instructional materials. |
| **6. Review and Iterate** | Evaluate materials for alignment, rigor, equity, and usability. Revise based on feedback and implementation data. | AI checks for consistency across materials, rewrites content at different levels, and generates alternative versions. |

## Standards-First Thinking

The most important habit in this cycle is starting with standards. Every prompt you write to AI should reference the specific standards you are targeting. This single practice eliminates the most common problem in AI-generated curriculum: content that is topically relevant but not aligned to what students actually need to learn.

When you skip standards analysis and jump straight to materials creation, you end up with lessons that cover a topic without building toward measurable outcomes. The design cycle prevents this by ensuring that every piece of content traces back to a specific learning goal.

## How the Cycle Connects to This Course

Each module in this course corresponds to work within one or more stages of the design cycle:

- **Foundations** (this module) establishes the principles that guide every stage
- **Workflow modules** provide step-by-step processes for specific design tasks within each stage
- **Prompt templates** give you ready-to-use starting points that embed standards-first thinking and backward design

As you move through the course, refer back to this cycle to understand where each workflow fits in the larger design process.
