# What Is PBL?

Project-based learning is an instructional approach where students learn by actively investigating and responding to an authentic, engaging, and complex problem or challenge.

## Key Features

PBL is defined by these elements:

- **Driving question** — An open-ended question that frames the entire project
- **Sustained inquiry** — Students investigate over days or weeks, not a single class period
- **Authenticity** — The work connects to real-world contexts and audiences
- **Student voice and choice** — Learners make meaningful decisions about their work
- **Reflection** — Students regularly assess their own learning
- **Critique and revision** — Work goes through feedback cycles
- **Public product** — Students create something for an audience beyond the teacher

## PBL vs. "Doing a Project"

| Feature | Traditional Project | PBL |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Timing | End of unit | IS the unit |
| Purpose | Demonstrate knowledge | Drive learning |
| Question | Teacher-assigned topic | Open-ended driving question |
| Audience | Teacher | Real-world stakeholder |
| Process | Individual execution | Collaborative inquiry |
| Assessment | Final product grade | Ongoing formative + summative |

## Where AI Fits

AI tools accelerate the design process but don't replace the pedagogical thinking behind PBL. You still need to:

- Choose appropriate standards and contexts
- Judge whether a driving question is genuinely engaging
- Decide if student roles are authentic
- Evaluate whether assessments align to learning goals

AI handles the drafting. You handle the design decisions.
