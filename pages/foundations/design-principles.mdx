# Design Principles

These principles guide every design decision in this course.

## 1. Standards First

Every PBL mission starts with identified learning standards. The project serves the standards — not the other way around.

## 2. Authentic Context

Students work on problems that exist in the real world. The context should be specific enough to be believable and broad enough to be meaningful.

## 3. Aligned Assessment

Assessment instruments directly measure the learning goals. If a standard isn't assessed, it shouldn't be listed as a goal.

## 4. Student Agency

Students make meaningful choices within a structured framework. Roles, tasks, and decision points give students ownership without removing scaffolding.

## 5. Iterative Design

No PBL mission is perfect on the first draft. Plan to revise based on student feedback and implementation experience.

## 6. Equity by Design

Access and inclusion are built into the design from the start — not added as modifications after the fact.

## Applying These Principles

As you work through each module, these principles will surface repeatedly. They're the criteria you'll use to evaluate AI-generated content and make design decisions.
