# Foundations

This module covers the core principles of AI-assisted curriculum design that inform every workflow and technique in this course.

## What You'll Learn

- What AI-assisted curriculum design is and how it works in practice
- How AI tools support but never replace teacher expertise and judgment
- Effective prompting principles for generating high-quality educational content
- The curriculum design cycle and how AI accelerates each stage

## Core Principles

AI-assisted curriculum design rests on a few key ideas:

1. **Teachers lead, AI assists.** AI generates drafts, options, and variations. Teachers make the decisions about what belongs in their classroom.
2. **Quality inputs produce quality outputs.** The specificity of your prompts directly determines the usefulness of what AI produces. Vague requests yield generic content.
3. **Design thinking still matters.** Understanding backward design, standards alignment, and assessment principles is essential. AI does not remove the need for pedagogical knowledge — it amplifies it.
4. **Iteration is the process.** AI-assisted design is not about getting a perfect result on the first try. It is about generating a strong starting point and refining it through professional judgment.

## How This Module Is Organized

- **What Is AI-Assisted Curriculum Design?** — Defines the approach and clarifies what AI does well versus what teachers do best.
- **Effective Prompting Principles** — The reference guide for writing prompts that produce useful, standards-aligned educational content.
- **The Curriculum Design Cycle** — An overview of backward design and how AI supports each stage from standards analysis through materials creation.
