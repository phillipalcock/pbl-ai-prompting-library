# Inclusive Design

Inclusive curriculum design means building access into every unit and lesson from the start — not retrofitting accommodations after the fact.

## Principles

### Representation
- Choose contexts and scenarios that reflect your students' communities
- Include diverse perspectives in example materials
- Avoid defaulting to contexts that privilege specific cultural backgrounds

### Multiple Means of Engagement
- Offer choices within tasks and activities
- Connect to varied interests and motivations
- Provide multiple entry points to essential questions and learning objectives

### Multiple Means of Representation
- Present information in text, visual, and audio formats where possible
- Define key vocabulary explicitly
- Use graphic organizers alongside written instructions

### Multiple Means of Action and Expression
- Allow students to demonstrate learning in different formats
- Provide structured templates alongside open-ended options
- Include sentence starters and exemplars

## Checking AI Output for Bias

AI-generated content may contain cultural assumptions, socioeconomic assumptions, or language that inadvertently excludes specific groups. Review all AI output through an equity lens before including it in student materials.
