# Inclusive Design

Inclusive PBL design means building access into the mission from the start — not retrofitting accommodations after the fact.

## Principles

### Representation
- Choose contexts and scenarios that reflect your students' communities
- Include diverse perspectives in example materials
- Avoid defaulting to contexts that privilege specific cultural backgrounds

### Multiple Means of Engagement
- Offer choices within roles and tasks
- Connect to varied interests and motivations
- Provide multiple entry points to the driving question

### Multiple Means of Representation
- Present information in text, visual, and audio formats where possible
- Define key vocabulary explicitly
- Use graphic organizers alongside written instructions

### Multiple Means of Action and Expression
- Allow students to demonstrate learning in different formats
- Provide structured templates alongside open-ended options
- Include sentence starters and exemplars

## Checking AI Output for Bias

AI-generated content may contain:
- Cultural assumptions (holidays, family structures, food references)
- Socioeconomic assumptions (access to technology, travel experiences)
- Language that inadvertently excludes specific groups
- Historical or scientific claims that reflect dominant narratives

Review all AI output through an equity lens before including it in student materials.
