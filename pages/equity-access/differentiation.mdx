# Differentiation Strategies

Effective curriculum design supports differentiation through flexible structures, student choice, and varied products. This section provides specific strategies applicable across instructional contexts.

## Tiered Differentiation

The same lesson or activity can be scaffolded at different levels:

| Support Level | Scaffolding |
|--------------|-------------|
| High support | Step-by-step instructions, sentence starters, graphic organizers, exemplars |
| Moderate support | Checklists, partially completed templates, peer collaboration protocols |
| Independent | Open-ended prompts, self-selected methods, extension challenges |

## Flexible Grouping

- Group by interest, not ability, for initial activity selection
- Allow task rotation if the unit length permits
- Pair students strategically within teams for peer support

## Material Modifications

- Provide texts at multiple reading levels on the same topic
- Create simplified and extended versions of data collection tools
- Offer choice in final product format (written, visual, oral, multimedia)

## AI Prompts for Differentiation

```
Rewrite the following instructional material at a [lower/higher] reading level while maintaining the same learning objectives and tasks:
[paste content]

Target reading level: [grade level]
Maintain: all learning goals and essential tasks
Simplify: vocabulary, sentence structure, and instruction complexity
```

## English Learner Supports

- Bilingual glossaries for key terms
- Visual instructions alongside written ones
- Sentence frames for written responses
- Partner work protocols that leverage home language
