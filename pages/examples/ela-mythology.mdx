## Unit Overview

Students investigate mythology as a cultural lens — examining how societies create stories to explain their world, reinforce values, and process collective experiences. They analyze classical myths alongside contemporary narratives from their own community, ultimately creating a multimedia exhibition that presents their findings to a public audience.

    ### Learning Goals

    **Tier 1: Content Knowledge**
    - Students will identify the structural elements common to myths across cultures (hero's journey, origin stories, moral tales).
    - Students will explain how historical and social context shapes the themes and characters of myths.
    - Students will define key literary terms: archetype, allegory, motif, symbolism, and narrative structure.

    **Tier 2: Skills and Processes**
    - Students will conduct close reading analysis of mythological texts, identifying literary devices and cultural values.
    - Students will gather primary source material (interviews, media analysis) about modern community narratives.
    - Students will compare texts across time periods using structured analytical frameworks.

    **Tier 3: Critical Thinking**
    - Students will evaluate the extent to which ancient myths and modern narratives serve parallel cultural functions.
    - Students will analyze how power, identity, and social values are embedded in the stories cultures tell about themselves.
    - Students will construct an original argument about the role of myth-making in contemporary society.

    **Tier 4: Communication and Collaboration**
    - Students will create a multimedia exhibition piece (written, visual, or audio) that presents their analysis.
    - Students will write an analytical essay connecting ancient and modern mythologies.
    - Students will present their work to a public audience with clear, engaging delivery.
