## Unit Overview

Students analyze real census, economic, and demographic data for their city or neighborhood to identify where youth services are most needed. They use statistical analysis, data visualization, and spatial reasoning to build evidence-based recommendations for a city planning commission about where to invest in new youth programs and facilities.

    ### Learning Goals

    **Tier 1: Content Knowledge**
    - Students will define and calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (range, interquartile range).
    - Students will explain how to read and interpret scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
    - Students will describe how demographic data is collected and organized by the U.S. Census Bureau.

    **Tier 2: Skills and Processes**
    - Students will calculate statistical measures for real-world data sets.
    - Students will construct appropriate data visualizations for different types of data.
    - Students will use proportional reasoning to compare data across neighborhoods of different sizes.

    **Tier 3: Critical Thinking**
    - Students will analyze patterns in demographic and economic data to identify areas of need.
    - Students will evaluate the strengths and limitations of different data sources and statistical measures.
    - Students will construct a data-driven argument supporting a specific investment recommendation.

    **Tier 4: Communication and Collaboration**
    - Students will present statistical findings using appropriate data visualizations and plain-language explanations.
    - Students will write a recommendation report that translates data analysis into actionable policy suggestions.
    - Students will respond to questions from the commission panel with evidence-based answers.

    ### Assessment Strategy

    **Checkpoints:**

    | Checkpoint | Timing | Deliverable | Weight |
    |-----------|--------|-------------|--------|
    | Data Inventory | End of Day 3 | Organized data sets with source citations | 10% |
    | Statistical Analysis | End of Week 1 | Completed calculations + initial visualizations | 20% |
    | Pattern Identification | Mid Week 2 | Written analysis of patterns + gap identification | 15% |
    | Draft Report | End of Week 2 | Full draft for peer review | 15% |
    | Final Presentation | End of Week 3 | Commission presentation + final report | 40% |

    **Rubric Criteria (Final Product):**

    | Criterion | Exceeds | Meets | Approaching | Beginning |
    |-----------|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|
    | Statistical Accuracy | All calculations correct with appropriate measures selected for each data type | Calculations correct for most analyses | Some calculation errors or inappropriate measure selection | Significant errors or missing calculations |
    | Data Visualization | Professional-quality visuals that reveal patterns clearly, with appropriate chart types | Clear, accurate visualizations with proper labels | Readable visuals but some issues with type selection or labeling | Unclear, mislabeled, or missing visualizations |
    | Argument Quality | Nuanced recommendations addressing multiple factors with cost-benefit consideration | Clear recommendations supported by statistical evidence | Recommendations present but weakly connected to data | No data-driven recommendations |
    | Communication | Engaging presentation with confident Q&A responses, accessible to non-technical audience | Clear presentation appropriate for the commission audience | Understandable but overly technical or disorganized | Unclear presentation with significant gaps |
    | Mathematical Reasoning | Demonstrates deep understanding of when and why to use different statistical approaches | Correctly applies statistical concepts to the analysis | Shows some understanding but with gaps in application | Does not demonstrate statistical reasoning |
