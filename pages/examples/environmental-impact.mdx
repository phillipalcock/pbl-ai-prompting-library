## Mission Overview

Students investigate water quality in their local watershed by collecting and analyzing data from multiple sites. They research how different land uses (residential, agricultural, industrial, recreational) affect water quality and present evidence-based recommendations to a panel acting as the city environmental board.

    ### Four-Tier Learning Goals

    **Tier 1: Content Knowledge**
    - Students will identify the key pollutants that affect freshwater ecosystems and their sources.
    - Students will explain how nutrient levels, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity indicate water health.
    - Students will describe how different land uses contribute to watershed pollution.

    **Tier 2: Skills and Processes**
    - Students will collect water quality data using standardized testing protocols.
    - Students will analyze data sets to identify patterns across sampling sites.
    - Students will create data visualizations (charts, graphs, maps) that communicate findings.

    **Tier 3: Critical Thinking**
    - Students will evaluate the relationship between land use patterns and water quality indicators.
    - Students will construct evidence-based arguments about which land uses pose the greatest risk.
    - Students will propose mitigation strategies supported by their data and research.

    **Tier 4: Communication and Collaboration**
    - Students will present findings to a panel using professional data visualizations.
    - Students will write a technical summary accessible to non-scientist community members.
    - Students will collaborate effectively within assigned roles to produce a cohesive final product.
