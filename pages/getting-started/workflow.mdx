# Your PBL Design Workflow

The AI-assisted PBL design process follows a structured sequence. Each module in this course corresponds to a phase in the workflow.

## The Design Sequence

1. **Define the Mission** — Write driving questions and establish real-world context
2. **Set Learning Goals** — Align objectives to standards using a four-tier framework
3. **Design Assessment** — Create rubrics and checkpoints that match your goals
4. **Assign Student Roles** — Define authentic roles with clear responsibilities
5. **Build the Workbook** — Create an 18-page student-facing document
6. **Polish and Refine** — Edit for clarity, visual design, and accessibility

## AI's Role at Each Phase

AI is a co-designer, not an autopilot. At each phase, you will:

- Provide the AI with specific inputs (standards, context, constraints)
- Review and evaluate AI-generated drafts
- Revise using your professional judgment
- Iterate until the output meets your quality standards

## Time Investment

Plan for 6-10 hours to complete a full PBL mission using this workflow. The AI accelerates drafting, but the thinking and decision-making are yours.
