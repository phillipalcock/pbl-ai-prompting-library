# Your Design Workflow

The AI-assisted curriculum design process follows a structured, iterative sequence. Each module in this course corresponds to a phase in the workflow.

## The Design Sequence

1. **Analyze Standards** — Unpack curriculum standards and identify key concepts, skills, and connections
2. **Define Objectives** — Write clear, measurable learning objectives aligned to your standards
3. **Plan Lessons** — Design instructional sequences, activities, and student experiences
4. **Design Assessment** — Create rubrics, formative checks, and summative assessments that match your objectives
5. **Create Materials** — Build student-facing resources, handouts, slides, and supporting documents
6. **Review and Refine** — Edit for clarity, coherence, accessibility, and alignment across all components

## AI's Role at Each Phase

AI is a co-designer, not an autopilot. At each phase, you will:

- Provide the AI with specific inputs (standards, context, constraints)
- Review and evaluate AI-generated drafts
- Revise using your professional judgment
- Iterate until the output meets your quality standards

## Time Investment

Plan for 4-10 hours to complete a full curriculum unit using this workflow, depending on scope and complexity. The AI accelerates drafting, but the thinking and decision-making are yours.
