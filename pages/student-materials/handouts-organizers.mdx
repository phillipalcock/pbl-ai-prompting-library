# Handouts & Graphic Organizers

Handouts and graphic organizers give students structured tools for processing information. A well-designed organizer makes thinking visible — it shows students how to sort, connect, compare, and sequence ideas.

## Types of Graphic Organizers

## When to Use Each Type

Choosing the right organizer depends on the thinking skill you want students to practice.

## Designing Effective Handouts

Handouts provide students with reference information, procedures, or structured space for a specific task. They differ from worksheets in that they are often kept and reused rather than turned in.

### Types of Handouts

**Information sheets** give students background content they will reference throughout a lesson or unit. Keep them to one page. Use headings, bullet points, and bold key terms.

**Reference cards** provide quick-lookup tools — formulas, vocabulary lists, rubric summaries, or step-by-step procedures. Design them to be scannable, not read linearly.

**Procedure guides** walk students through a multi-step process such as a lab protocol, research method, or peer review process. Number every step. Include safety notes or tips in callout boxes.

### Handout Design Principles

<Callout type="info" title="Design for re-use">
If students will return to a handout multiple times, design it for quick scanning. Use clear headings, numbered sections, and visual separation between blocks of content.
</Callout>

- **One purpose per handout.** If a handout tries to do two things, split it into two handouts.
- **Front-load the most important information.** Students read top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Put the key content where their eyes land first.
- **Use consistent formatting.** If you bold vocabulary words on one handout, bold them on every handout.
- **Include a title and date.** Students lose papers. Make every handout identifiable at a glance.

## AI Prompts for Graphic Organizers and Handouts

### Generate a Graphic Organizer

```
Create a [type of organizer] for students to use during a lesson on [topic].

Subject: [subject]
Grade level: [grade]
Purpose: Students need to [describe the thinking task — e.g., "compare two historical perspectives" or "sequence the steps of cell division"]

Include:
- A clear title
- Brief instructions (1-2 sentences) telling students what to do
- Labeled sections or columns appropriate to the organizer type
- An example entry in the first section to model the expected response

Write all text in student-facing language.
```

### Generate an Information Handout

```
Create a one-page student information handout on [topic].

Subject: [subject]
Grade level: [grade]
Reading level: [target reading level]
Context: Students will use this handout as a reference during [describe the activity or unit].

Include:
- A clear title
- 3-5 short sections with headings
- Key vocabulary in bold with brief definitions in context
- No more than 300 words total

Write in second person where appropriate. Keep sentences short and direct.
```

### Generate a Procedure Guide

```
Create a step-by-step procedure guide for students to follow during [activity].

Subject: [subject]
Grade level: [grade]
Activity: [describe the task — e.g., "conducting a water quality test" or "peer reviewing a partner's essay"]

Include:
- A title and one-sentence overview
- Numbered steps (no more than 10)
- Any safety notes or important reminders as callout boxes
- A "Check Your Work" section at the end with 2-3 self-check questions

Write in imperative voice ("Collect your materials," "Record your results").
```
