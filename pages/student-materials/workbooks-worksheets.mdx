# Workbook & Worksheet Creation

Student-facing documents are the primary interface between your lesson design and your students' experience. This page covers how to structure, design, and generate workbooks, worksheets, packets, and study guides.

## Types of Student-Facing Documents

## Structuring Multi-Page Workbooks

A workbook tells a story — it moves students from introduction through investigation to synthesis. Organize pages in a logical sequence that mirrors how students will experience the work.

### Recommended Workbook Flow

1. **Opening pages** — Cover, overview, goals, and timeline
2. **Input pages** — Background reading, vocabulary, and key concepts
3. **Activity pages** — Guided tasks, investigations, and data collection
4. **Synthesis pages** — Analysis, drafting, and product creation
5. **Closing pages** — Reflection, self-assessment, and presentation prep

<Callout type="info" title="Scope each page deliberately">
Every page should serve a clear purpose. If you cannot state in one sentence what a page asks students to do, it needs to be simplified or split.
</Callout>

## Page Types

Each page in a workbook or packet falls into one of four categories. Understanding these categories helps you design pages that function well.

### Instructional Pages

Provide information students need. Keep text concise and use visuals to support understanding.

- Maximum 200 words of instruction per page
- Use numbered steps for procedures
- Include visual examples where possible

### Activity Pages

Guide students through specific tasks. Structure is critical — students should know exactly what to do.

- Clear task header stating the goal
- Step-by-step instructions
- Designated response areas with enough space
- Estimated time for completion

### Data and Evidence Pages

Provide templates for collecting and organizing information.

- Pre-formatted tables or graphic organizers
- Column headers already filled in
- Example entries to show expected format
- Space for source citations

### Reflection Pages

Prompt students to think about their learning process.

- Open-ended questions (not yes/no)
- Sentence starters for struggling writers
- Connection to specific learning goals
- Space for both individual and team reflection

## AI Prompts for Generating Workbook and Worksheet Content

### Generate a Full Workbook Page

```
Generate content for a student workbook page.

Topic: [topic or unit]
Page purpose: [describe what this page should accomplish]
Page type: [instructional / activity / data collection / reflection]
Grade level: [grade]
Reading level: [target reading level]

Write in direct, student-facing language using "you" and "your."
Include clear instructions and designated spaces for student responses.
Keep instructions under 200 words.
```

### Generate a Single Worksheet

```
Create a one-page student worksheet for the following lesson:

Subject: [subject]
Lesson topic: [topic]
Learning objective: [what students should be able to do after completing this]
Grade level: [grade]

The worksheet should include:
- A brief introduction (2-3 sentences) explaining the task
- Clear, numbered instructions
- Space for student responses (describe the format: lined space, table, diagram, etc.)
- A closing question that asks students to explain their thinking

Use direct, student-facing language. Write at a [grade]-level reading level.
```

### Generate a Study Guide

```
Create a student study guide for the following unit:

Subject: [subject]
Unit: [unit title]
Key concepts: [list 4-6 concepts]
Grade level: [grade]

Include:
- A summary section for each concept (2-3 sentences each)
- A vocabulary review with definitions in student-friendly language
- 3-5 practice questions that mirror the assessment format
- A self-check section where students rate their confidence on each concept

Write in second person ("you"). Keep language clear and direct.
```
