# Standards Alignment

Every learning goal in your PBL mission must trace back to a specific standard. This section shows how to maintain that alignment.

## The Alignment Check

For each learning goal, verify:

1. It directly addresses a stated standard
2. It's assessed somewhere in the project
3. The assessment method matches the cognitive level of the goal
4. Students have instruction or scaffolding to reach the goal

If any of these checks fail, revise the goal or add the missing element.

## Alignment Grid

Use this format to track alignment:

| Standard | Learning Goal (Tier) | Assessment Method | Where in Project |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| NGSS MS-LS2-1 | Analyze ecosystem interactions (Tier 2) | Data analysis report | Week 2, Day 3 |
| CCSS.ELA W.7.1 | Construct evidence-based argument (Tier 3) | Written recommendation | Final product |
