# Writing Objectives

Clear learning objectives make everything else in PBL design easier — from assessment to workbook content.

## Anatomy of a Good Objective

A strong objective includes:

1. **Subject** — "Students will..."
2. **Measurable verb** — An action you can observe and assess
3. **Content** — What they're working with
4. **Context or condition** — The situation or constraint

**Example:** Students will *analyze* water quality data *from three local sources* to *identify patterns in contamination levels*.

## Verbs to Use (and Avoid)

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Analyze | Understand |
| Compare | Know |
| Design | Learn about |
| Evaluate | Appreciate |
| Construct | Be familiar with |
| Justify | Be aware of |

The left column describes observable actions. The right column describes internal states you can't directly assess.

## Common Mistakes

- **Too vague:** "Students will understand ecosystems" — How will you know?
- **Too narrow:** "Students will label the parts of a cell" — This is a task, not a goal
- **Not aligned:** The objective doesn't match the standard it claims to address
- **Not assessable:** No clear way to measure whether the student met the goal
