# Four-Tier Framework

The four-tier framework organizes learning goals by type, ensuring your PBL mission develops a range of skills and knowledge.

## The Four Tiers

### Tier 1: Content Knowledge
What students need to know. These are the facts, concepts, and vocabulary from your standards.

**Example:** Students will identify the key components of an ecosystem and explain how energy flows through food webs.

### Tier 2: Skills and Processes
What students need to be able to do. These are the disciplinary and cross-cutting skills.

**Example:** Students will analyze data sets to identify patterns and draw evidence-based conclusions.

### Tier 3: Critical Thinking
How students need to think. These involve analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.

**Example:** Students will evaluate competing solutions to an environmental problem using scientific criteria and community impact data.

### Tier 4: Communication and Collaboration
How students share and work together. These are the presentation, writing, and teamwork goals.

**Example:** Students will present findings to a community panel using data visualizations and clear, audience-appropriate language.

## Why Four Tiers?

A single project can and should address multiple types of learning. The four-tier framework ensures you don't default to only content recall or only process skills.

## Using AI to Draft Tier Goals

Prompt template:
```
I am designing a PBL mission for [grade level] [subject].
The relevant standards are: [paste standards].
Generate 2-3 learning objectives for each of the four tiers:
1. Content Knowledge
2. Skills and Processes
3. Critical Thinking
4. Communication and Collaboration
Write each objective as a measurable student outcome starting with "Students will..."
```
