## Phillip Alcock

I'm Phillip Alcock, an educator and founder of **PBL Future Labs**, dedicated to helping educators design rigorous, engaging project-based learning experiences using AI tools.

This site — **edu-workflows.ai** — is a practical guide I built to walk educators through every stage of AI-assisted curriculum design, from unpacking standards to building student-facing materials.
