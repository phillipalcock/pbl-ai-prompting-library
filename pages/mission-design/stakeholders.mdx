# Stakeholder Audiences

A stakeholder audience gives students a reason to care about quality. When students present to a real audience — not just their teacher — the stakes change.

<Callout type="info" title="Key principle">
The audience shapes the product. Students write differently for a city council than for their peers. Choose your stakeholder audience before designing the final product.

## Selecting the Right Audience

Match the audience to your learning goals:

<Accordion variant="separated" my="md">
  <Accordion.Item value="writing-goals">
    <Accordion.Control>If your goals emphasize persuasive writing</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Choose decision-makers. Students must construct arguments, anticipate counterarguments, and write with formal precision. A city council member expects different writing than a peer.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="data-goals">
    <Accordion.Control>If your goals emphasize data analysis</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Choose expert panels. Scientists and analysts expect evidence-based claims, proper data visualization, and acknowledgment of limitations. This pushes students toward rigorous analysis.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="communication-goals">
    <Accordion.Control>If your goals emphasize clear communication</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Choose younger students or community members. Explaining complex ideas in accessible language is harder than it sounds. Students must deeply understand content to simplify it effectively.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="collaboration-goals">
    <Accordion.Control>If your goals emphasize collaboration</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Choose a multi-stakeholder audience. When different audience members have different needs, teams must coordinate to address all perspectives in their final product.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>

## Making Audiences Accessible

Not every school can bring in a city council member. Alternatives:

- **Video presentations** — Record and send to the stakeholder
- **Written feedback** — Stakeholders review student work remotely
- **Simulated panels** — Teachers, administrators, or parents role-play as the audience
- **Published work** — Post student products where stakeholders can access them
- **Virtual meetings** — Video conference with outside experts

The key is that students believe their audience is real and that their work will be seen by someone beyond the classroom.

## Audience Profile Template

For each stakeholder audience, document:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who they are** | Title and organization |
| **What they care about** | Their priorities and concerns |
| **What they need** | The format and content they expect |
| **How they'll receive it** | Presentation, document, video, etc. |
| **What they'll do with it** | How the work informs their decisions |
