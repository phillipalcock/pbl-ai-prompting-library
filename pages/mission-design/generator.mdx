# Driving Question Generator

Use this interactive tool to generate driving question options for your PBL mission. Enter your curriculum standard, select your subject and grade level, and the generator will produce five question options — one for each template type.

<Callout type="info" title="How this works">
The generator creates driving questions using the five template structures from the Driving Questions section: Design Challenge, Investigation, Evaluation, Perspective Analysis, and Data-Driven Argument. Review the generated options and edit them to fit your specific context.

2. **Evaluate it** — Check it against the self-assessment checklist on the [Driving Questions](/mission-design/driving-questions) page
3. **Develop context** — Build a scenario using the [Real-World Context](/mission-design/real-world-context) guide
4. **Identify your audience** — Profile stakeholders using the [Stakeholder Audiences](/mission-design/stakeholders) guide
5. **Draft your mission statement** — Combine everything in the [Practice Exercises](/mission-design/practice)
