2. Investigation: "What is the impact of..."
3. Evaluation: "To what extent does..."
4. Perspective analysis: "How do different..."
5. Data-driven argument: "Based on...data..."

## Exercise 2: Context Building

**Task:** Develop a full context scenario for your driving question.

**Steps:**
1. Start with the driving question from Exercise 1
2. Identify a specific local context (school, neighborhood, city)
3. Write a 3-5 sentence scenario
4. Verify the scenario includes: situation, problem, student role, and deliverable

{`MISSION: [Title]
SUBJECT: [Subject] | GRADE: [Grade] | DURATION: [Weeks]

DRIVING QUESTION:
[Your driving question]

CONTEXT:
[Your 3-5 sentence scenario]

STAKEHOLDER AUDIENCE:
