# Driving Questions

The driving question is the engine of a PBL mission. It defines what students investigate, frames the scope of the project, and determines whether the work feels authentic or artificial.

<Callout type="info" title="What is a driving question?">
A driving question is an open-ended, engaging question that students investigate over the course of a project. It cannot be answered with a simple Google search. It requires sustained inquiry, evidence gathering, and original thinking.
</Callout>

## Anatomy of a Driving Question

Every effective driving question has four components:

## Before and After: Weak vs. Strong Driving Questions

<Callout type="warning" title="Learn from common mistakes">
Most weak driving questions fail because they're too broad, too narrow, or don't require original thinking. Compare these pairs.
</Callout>

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Weak Version</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Problem</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Strong Version</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>"What is climate change?"</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Googleable — no inquiry needed</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"How should our city prepare its infrastructure for the climate impacts predicted for our region by 2050?"</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>"Why is math important?"</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Too abstract — no context or audience</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"Based on local business data, what financial recommendations can we make to a student-run school store to maximize its impact?"</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>"Build a bridge out of toothpicks"</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>A task, not a question — no driving inquiry</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"How can we design a pedestrian bridge for our community park that is both structurally sound and accessible to all users?"</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>"How does the government work?"</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Too broad — could go anywhere</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"How should our city council allocate its limited budget to best serve the needs identified in our community survey?"</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>"What are the parts of a cell?"</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Factual recall — no sustained inquiry</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"How can we explain to younger students why understanding cell biology matters for making informed health decisions?"</Table.Td>

## Common Mistakes

<Accordion variant="contained" my="md">
  <Accordion.Item value="mistake-1">
    <Accordion.Control>Too broad: The question could sustain a PhD dissertation</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>If your question could take years to answer, narrow the context. Add a specific location, time frame, or audience. "How can we solve pollution?" becomes "How can we reduce single-use plastic waste in our school cafeteria this semester?"</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="mistake-2">
    <Accordion.Control>Too narrow: The question has one right answer</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>If students can answer the question in a single sentence, it's not a driving question. "What is the chemical formula for water?" is a recall question. Driving questions require investigation, analysis, and judgment.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="mistake-3">
    <Accordion.Control>No authentic audience: Only the teacher will see the answer</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Students engage more deeply when their work has a real audience. Identify who, outside the classroom, would benefit from or care about the students' findings. This could be community members, local officials, younger students, or organizations.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="mistake-4">
    <Accordion.Control>Disguised assignment: It's really just a task with a question mark</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>"How do you make a poster about the water cycle?" is a task in question form. A driving question requires genuine inquiry where the answer isn't predetermined. Students should need to investigate, analyze, and form their own conclusions.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="mistake-5">
    <Accordion.Control>Not connected to standards: Engaging but doesn't teach the curriculum</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>A driving question must connect to your learning standards. Start with the standards and build the question around them — not the other way around. If the question is exciting but doesn't address what students need to learn, revise it.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
