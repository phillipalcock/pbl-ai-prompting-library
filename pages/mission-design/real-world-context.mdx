# Real-World Context

A PBL mission needs a context that makes the work feel real. Students should believe that their investigation matters beyond the classroom.

<Callout type="info" title="Why context matters">
Context transforms a school assignment into a meaningful investigation. When students work within a believable scenario, they engage more deeply, think more critically, and produce higher-quality work.

## What Makes a Context "Real"

Strong real-world contexts share these features:

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">

## Building a Context Scenario

A context scenario is a short narrative (3-5 sentences) that sets the stage for the mission. It should include:

1. **The situation** — What's happening
2. **The problem or opportunity** — Why it matters
3. **The role students play** — How they fit in
4. **The deliverable** — What they're creating

### Example Scenario

> The City of Riverside is updating its parks master plan for the next decade. The parks department has asked community groups to propose improvements based on resident needs and usage data. Your team has been selected as a youth advisory panel. You will analyze park usage data, survey community members, and present a data-driven proposal to the parks department board.
