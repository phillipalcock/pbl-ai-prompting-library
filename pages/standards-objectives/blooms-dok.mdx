# Bloom's Taxonomy & DOK Alignment

Two frameworks are essential for verifying the cognitive rigor of your learning objectives: Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK). This page covers both frameworks and shows how to use AI to check that your objectives hit the right level.

## Bloom's Taxonomy: Six Levels of Cognitive Process

Bloom's Taxonomy organizes thinking skills from simple recall to complex creation. Each level builds on the ones below it.

## Webb's Depth of Knowledge: Four Levels

While Bloom's focuses on the *type* of thinking, Webb's DOK focuses on the *depth and complexity* of thinking required. The same verb can appear at different DOK levels depending on context.

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>DOK Level</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Description</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>What It Looks Like</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Level 1: Recall & Reproduction**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Recall a fact, term, or procedure</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Define vocabulary, identify elements on a diagram, follow a one-step procedure</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Level 2: Skills & Concepts**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Use information, apply a concept, make decisions about how to approach a problem</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Classify items into categories, compare two texts, solve a multi-step problem with a known method</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Level 3: Strategic Thinking**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Reason, plan, justify, and use evidence. Requires abstract thinking and multiple steps without a predetermined path</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Construct an argument with evidence, analyze a data set for patterns, design an investigation</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Level 4: Extended Thinking**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Investigate, synthesize across sources, apply concepts to new situations over time</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Conduct a research project, create an original proposal to solve a community problem, synthesize multiple sources into a position paper</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

<Callout type="info" title="Bloom's vs. DOK">
A common misconception is that Bloom's and DOK are interchangeable. They are not. Bloom's describes the *type* of thinking (e.g., analyze, evaluate). DOK describes the *depth* required. You can have a Bloom's "Analyze" task at DOK Level 2 (compare two items in a straightforward way) or at DOK Level 3 (analyze a complex data set to draw original conclusions). Always check both.

## Using AI to Level-Check Objectives

The most common alignment error is writing objectives that claim a high cognitive level but actually require only recall or basic application. AI can help catch this.

### Prompt 1: Classify Objectives by Bloom's and DOK

```
Classify each of the following learning objectives by Bloom's Taxonomy level and Webb's Depth of Knowledge level. For each objective, provide:

1. The Bloom's level (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
2. The DOK level (1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. A brief justification explaining why you assigned each level
4. Whether the verb matches the actual cognitive demand (sometimes a verb like "identify" is used but the task actually requires analysis)

Objectives:
1. [paste objective 1]
2. [paste objective 2]
3. [paste objective 3]
4. [paste objective 4]
```

### Prompt 2: Check Alignment Between Standard and Objective

```
I need to verify that the following learning objectives match the cognitive demand of their source standard.

Standard: [paste full standard text]
Standard code: [e.g., NGSS MS-LS2-4]
Expected cognitive level: [e.g., Bloom's: Evaluate, DOK: 3]

Objectives derived from this standard:
1. [paste objective 1]
2. [paste objective 2]
3. [paste objective 3]

For each objective, tell me:
- Does it match the cognitive demand of the standard?
- Is it too high or too low?
- If misaligned, suggest a revised version at the correct level
```

### Prompt 3: Elevate Low-Level Objectives

```
The following objectives are currently at a low cognitive level (Bloom's: Remember or Understand). I need to revise them to reach higher levels while keeping the same content focus.

Objectives:
1. [paste low-level objective 1]
2. [paste low-level objective 2]

For each objective, provide revised versions at:
- Bloom's Apply level
- Bloom's Analyze level
- Bloom's Evaluate or Create level

Keep the same subject matter but increase the cognitive demand. Explain what changes you made and why.
```

## Common Misalignments and How to Fix Them

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Problem</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Example</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Fix</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Standard requires analysis; objective requires recall**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Standard says "analyze interactions"; objective says "list the parts of an ecosystem"</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Replace "list" with "analyze how changes to one component affect other parts of the ecosystem"</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Objective uses a high-level verb but describes a low-level task**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"Evaluate the definition of photosynthesis" — this is recall dressed up as evaluation</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Make the task genuinely evaluative: "Evaluate two competing explanations for declining plant growth using evidence from lab observations"</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Objective exceeds the standard's demand**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Standard requires DOK 2; objective asks students to design an original investigation (DOK 4)</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Scale back to the standard's level. Over-shooting is not automatically better — it can leave foundational skills unassessed</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Multiple cognitive levels collapsed into one objective**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>"Students will identify, analyze, and evaluate ecosystem data" — this spans three Bloom's levels</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Split into separate objectives, one per cognitive level, so you can assess each distinctly</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

<Callout type="warning" title="Do not rely on verb lists alone">
Verb lists (like those in the Bloom's table above) are a starting point, not a rule book. The cognitive level of an objective depends on what the student actually has to *do*, not just which verb you used. "Identify the pattern in a data set" requires analysis. "Identify the capital of France" requires recall. Always evaluate the full objective in context.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Quick alignment check">
After writing your objectives, run this three-part check:
1. **Verb check** — Does the verb match the intended cognitive level?
2. **Task check** — Does the actual task require the thinking the verb implies?
3. **Standard check** — Does the objective's cognitive level match the source standard?

If all three align, your objective is solid. If any one fails, revise before moving to assessment design.
