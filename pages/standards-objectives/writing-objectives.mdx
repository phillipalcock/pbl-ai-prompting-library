# Writing Learning Objectives

Clear learning objectives make everything else in curriculum design easier — from assessment to lesson materials.

## Anatomy of a Good Objective

A strong objective includes:

1. **Subject** — "Students will..."
2. **Measurable verb** — An action you can observe and assess
3. **Content** — What they're working with
4. **Context or condition** — The situation or constraint

**Example:** Students will *analyze* water quality data *from three local sources* to *identify patterns in contamination levels*.

## Verbs to Use (and Avoid)

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Use (Observable Actions)</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Avoid (Internal States)</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Analyze</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Understand</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Compare</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Know</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Design</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Learn about</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Evaluate</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Appreciate</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Construct</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Be familiar with</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Justify</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Be aware of</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

The left column describes observable actions. The right column describes internal states you cannot directly assess.

## Common Mistakes

- **Too vague:** "Students will understand ecosystems" — How will you know?
- **Too narrow:** "Students will label the parts of a cell" — This is a task, not a learning objective
- **Not aligned:** The objective does not match the standard it claims to address
- **Not assessable:** No clear way to measure whether the student met the objective

<Callout type="warning" title="The 'understand' trap">
If your objective uses "understand," "know," or "learn about," ask yourself: *What would a student do to show they understand?* Replace the vague verb with that observable action. "Understand photosynthesis" becomes "Explain the process of photosynthesis, identifying the inputs, outputs, and energy transformation involved."

## Writing Objectives from Unpacked Standards

Once you have unpacked a standard (see [Unpacking Standards](/standards-objectives/unpacking-standards)), each knowledge component and skill becomes a candidate for a learning objective. The process is:

1. Take one skill-knowledge pair from your unpacked standard
2. Add a measurable verb that matches the cognitive demand level
3. Specify the content students will work with
4. Include any conditions from the standard
5. Check that the objective is specific enough to assess but broad enough to teach toward

**From standard to objective — example:**

- **Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.8.6 — *Determine an author's point of view or purpose in a text and analyze how the author acknowledges and responds to conflicting evidence or viewpoints.*
- **Unpacked skills:** Determine point of view; analyze response to conflicting evidence
- **Objective 1:** Students will identify the author's point of view in an informational text and cite specific passages that reveal the author's purpose.
- **Objective 2:** Students will analyze how an author acknowledges conflicting evidence by comparing the author's claims with at least two counterarguments presented in the text.

## AI Prompt Templates for Generating Objectives

### Prompt 1: Generate Objectives from a Standard

```
I have unpacked the following standard and need to write measurable learning objectives.

Standard: [paste the full standard text]
Standard code: [e.g., CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.8.6]

Unpacked components:
- Skills: [list the skills you identified]
- Knowledge: [list the knowledge components]
- Cognitive demand: [Bloom's level / DOK level]
- Conditions: [any conditions from the standard]

Please generate 3-5 measurable learning objectives that collectively address this standard. Each objective should:
1. Begin with "Students will..."
2. Use an observable, measurable verb
3. Specify the content students will work with
4. Include conditions where appropriate
5. Match the cognitive demand level of the standard
```

### Prompt 2: Improve Existing Objectives

```
Review the following learning objectives and improve them. For each objective, check that it:
- Uses a measurable verb (not "understand," "know," or "learn about")
- Is specific enough to assess
- Matches the cognitive level of its source standard
- Includes appropriate conditions or context

Objectives:
1. [paste objective 1]
2. [paste objective 2]
3. [paste objective 3]

Source standard: [paste the standard, if applicable]

For each objective, provide:
- The original objective
- Issues identified
- A revised version
- The Bloom's Taxonomy level of the revised objective
```

### Prompt 3: Differentiate Objectives by Cognitive Level

```
I need to write learning objectives at multiple cognitive levels for the following topic, so I can differentiate instruction and assessment.

Topic: [describe the topic or content area]
Source standard: [paste the standard]

Please generate one learning objective at each of these Bloom's Taxonomy levels:
1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

Each objective should address the same core content but require progressively deeper thinking.
```

<Callout type="info" title="Quality check">
After generating objectives with AI, verify each one against your unpacked standard. AI-generated objectives sometimes drift from the standard's actual requirements — adding content that is not in the standard or missing a key skill. Always cross-reference.
