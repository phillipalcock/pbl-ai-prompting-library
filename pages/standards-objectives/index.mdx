# Standards & Learning Objectives

This section covers the foundational skills of deconstructing curriculum standards and writing clear, measurable learning objectives — with AI-assisted workflows at every step.

## What You'll Learn

- **Deconstructing curriculum standards** — How to unpack a standard into its component knowledge, skills, and cognitive demands
- **Writing measurable learning objectives** — Crafting objectives that are specific, observable, and assessable
- **AI-powered level-checking** — Using AI to verify that objectives align to the correct levels of Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge
- **Alignment verification techniques** — Systematic approaches to ensure objectives faithfully represent the intent of their source standards

## Why This Matters

Standards are the starting point for all curriculum design. But a standard on its own is too broad to teach or assess directly. The work of translating standards into actionable learning objectives is where effective instruction begins.

AI tools can accelerate this process significantly — helping you identify implicit skills within a standard, generate objective drafts at the right cognitive level, and catch misalignments before they reach students.
