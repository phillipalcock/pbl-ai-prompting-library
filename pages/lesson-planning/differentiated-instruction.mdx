# Differentiated Instruction

Differentiated instruction means proactively adjusting what you teach, how you teach it, and how students demonstrate learning so that every student can access rigorous content and grow. This page covers the three primary dimensions of differentiation — content, process, and product — along with practical strategies for grouping by readiness, interest, and learning profile.

<Callout type="info" title="Differentiation is not separate lesson plans">
Differentiation does not mean writing a different lesson for every student. It means designing one lesson with intentional flexibility built in — multiple entry points, varied supports, and choices that allow students to engage at their level while working toward the same objectives.
</Callout>

## The Three Dimensions of Differentiation

### Content Differentiation

Adjusting **what** students learn or the materials through which they access the content. The learning objective stays the same; the pathway to it varies.

**Strategies:**
- Provide texts on the same topic at different reading levels
- Offer video, audio, and visual alternatives to written sources
- Use tiered vocabulary lists (essential terms for all, extended terms for advanced)
- Pre-teach foundational concepts to students who need background knowledge
- Provide primary source excerpts at varying complexity levels

### Process Differentiation

Adjusting **how** students engage with and make sense of the content. This is about the activities and thinking strategies students use during the lesson.

**Strategies:**
- Offer graphic organizers with varying levels of scaffolding (blank, partially completed, fully structured)
- Provide choice in how students take notes (outline, sketch notes, Cornell notes)
- Use tiered tasks that address the same objective at different levels of complexity
- Allow flexible pacing so students who finish early can extend while others continue
- Create learning stations with different modalities (reading, listening, hands-on)

### Product Differentiation

Adjusting **how** students demonstrate what they have learned. The assessment criteria remain consistent; the format varies.

**Strategies:**
- Allow choice of product format: essay, presentation, infographic, video, podcast
- Provide rubrics that assess the learning objective regardless of format
- Offer structured templates for students who need support and open-ended options for those who do not
- Create tiered project options with the same core requirements but different levels of complexity

## Readiness-Based Grouping

Readiness-based grouping means forming temporary groups based on students' current skill levels for a specific task. These groups are flexible and change frequently.

**Guidelines:**
- Use formative assessment data (not grades) to form groups
- Regroup frequently — readiness varies by topic and skill
- Avoid labeling groups with names that signal rank
- Provide the highest-support group with the most teacher time
- Ensure all groups work toward the same standard at appropriate complexity

<Accordion variant="separated">
  <Accordion.Item value="tiered-example">
    <Accordion.Control>Example: Tiered Task for Reading Comprehension</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      **Objective:** Students will identify the central idea of an informational text and explain how it is supported by key details.

      **Group A (Approaching):** Read a shorter, simplified version of the text. Use a graphic organizer with sentence starters to identify the central idea and two supporting details. Work with the teacher in a small group.

      **Group B (Meeting):** Read the full text. Identify the central idea and three supporting details. Write a paragraph explaining the relationship between the central idea and the details.

      **Group C (Extending):** Read the full text plus a related secondary source. Identify the central idea of each and compare how both authors develop their arguments. Write a comparative analysis paragraph.
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>

## Interest-Based Choices

Interest-based differentiation motivates students by connecting learning to topics they care about, while still addressing the same skill or standard.

**Guidelines:**
- Offer 2–4 options, not unlimited choice (too many options can overwhelm)
- Ensure all options require the same depth of thinking
- Let students self-select rather than assigning based on perceived interest
- Design a common rubric that applies to all options

**Example:** In a persuasive writing unit, students choose their topic from a curated list (school policy, environmental issue, community concern, sports-related debate). All students follow the same argument structure and are assessed on the same criteria.

## Learning Profile Accommodations

Learning profile differentiation accounts for how students prefer to learn — their preferred modality, work environment, and social configuration.

**Strategies:**
- Offer content in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, graphic)
- Allow choice in work setting (desk, floor, standing, quiet corner)
- Vary social configuration (individual, pair, small group)
- Provide both digital and analog options for tasks
- Build in movement breaks and varied activity types within the lesson

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid fixed learning style labels">
Research does not support the idea that students have a single fixed learning style. Instead of labeling students as "visual learners" or "auditory learners," offer variety within lessons so all students benefit from multiple modalities.

## AI Prompts for Creating Differentiated Materials

### Create Tiered Versions of a Task

```
I have the following learning activity for [grade level] [subject]:
[paste activity description]

The learning objective is: [paste objective]

Create three tiered versions of this activity:
1. Approaching — Simplified language, additional scaffolding (graphic organizers, sentence starters), reduced complexity while maintaining the core objective
2. Meeting — The activity as designed for grade-level students
3. Extending — Increased complexity, deeper analysis, fewer scaffolds, connection to additional concepts

All three versions must address the same learning objective.
```

### Adapt Text to Multiple Reading Levels

```
Rewrite the following text at three different reading levels while preserving the key content and concepts:
[paste original text]

Version 1: Approximately [lower grade] reading level — shorter sentences, simpler vocabulary, key ideas preserved
Version 2: Grade-level ([grade]) — the original or lightly edited for clarity
Version 3: Advanced — more complex sentence structures, additional academic vocabulary, extended examples

Label each version with its approximate reading level.
```

### Generate Interest-Based Options

```
I need to create choice options for the following assignment:
[paste assignment description]

The learning objective is: [paste objective]
Grade level: [grade]
Subject: [subject]

Generate 4 different versions of this assignment, each set in a different real-world context that would appeal to different student interests (e.g., sports, technology, arts, community issues). All versions must:
- Address the same learning objective
- Require the same depth of thinking
- Be assessable with the same rubric criteria
```

### Create Scaffolded Graphic Organizers

```
I need a graphic organizer for the following task:
[paste task description]

Create three versions:
1. High support — Most sections pre-filled with examples, sentence starters in every box, word bank provided
2. Moderate support — Section headers and guiding questions provided, one example included
3. Low support — Section headers only, open-ended

All three versions should guide students through the same thinking process and lead to the same type of final product.
```
