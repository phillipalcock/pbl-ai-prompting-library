# Lesson Plan Generator

This page provides a step-by-step guided workflow for generating a complete lesson plan using AI. Work through each step in order, copying the prompt templates into your preferred AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar) and customizing the bracketed fields with your specific information.

<Callout type="info" title="How to use this page">
Follow the five steps below in sequence. Each step builds on the output of the previous one. After each AI response, review and edit the output before moving to the next step. The AI generates a starting draft — your professional judgment shapes it into a plan that works for your students. You can use these prompts with any AI assistant.

## Step 1: Set the Context

Start by giving the AI all the information it needs about your teaching context, standards, and objectives. The more specific you are, the better the output.

```
I need to create a lesson plan with the following details:

Subject: [e.g., 8th Grade U.S. History]
Grade Level: [e.g., 8th grade]
Class Period Length: [e.g., 52 minutes]
Number of Students: [e.g., 30]
Unit Topic: [e.g., Causes of the American Revolution]

Standards Addressed:
[Paste the specific standards, e.g., "CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.6-8.2: Determine the central ideas or information of a primary or secondary source"]

Learning Objectives (what students will know or be able to do by the end of the lesson):
1. [e.g., Students will identify three major causes of the American Revolution]
2. [e.g., Students will analyze a primary source document for perspective and bias]
3. [e.g., Students will explain how colonial grievances escalated into revolution]

Student Context:
- Prior knowledge: [e.g., Students have completed a unit on colonial life and government]
- Relevant needs: [e.g., 5 English learners at intermediate proficiency, 3 students with IEPs requiring extended time]

Based on this information, generate a lesson overview that includes:
- A lesson title
- A one-sentence lesson summary
- The essential question for the lesson
- A list of prerequisite knowledge students need
- Materials and resources required
```

After receiving the response, review the lesson overview. Edit the essential question and objectives as needed before continuing.

## Step 2: Design the Lesson Structure

Now ask the AI to build the instructional sequence. Reference the lesson structures from the [Structure & Sequencing](/lesson-planning/structure-sequencing) page to guide your choice.

```
Using the lesson context I just provided, design the full lesson structure.

Use the following lesson framework: [choose one: Gradual Release (I Do–We Do–You Do) / 5E Model / Workshop Model]

For each phase of the lesson, provide:
- Phase name and time allocation
- What the teacher does
- What students do
- Key questions the teacher should ask
- Materials used in that phase
- How the teacher checks for understanding

The total lesson must fit within [class period length] minutes.
Include transitions between each phase with specific instructions.
Make sure the lesson builds toward the stated learning objectives, not just covers the topic.
```

Review the structure. Check that the time allocations are realistic and that each phase directly supports at least one learning objective.

## Step 3: Detail the Learning Activities

With the structure in place, ask the AI to flesh out the specific activities for each phase.

```
For the lesson structure you just created, now design the specific learning activities in detail.

For each activity, provide:
1. Step-by-step instructions (what the teacher says and does)
2. Student directions (written clearly enough to display or distribute)
3. Grouping strategy (individual, pairs, small groups, whole class) and rationale
4. The specific Bloom's Taxonomy level the activity targets
5. Expected student output (what students produce during the activity)
6. Timing for each step within the activity

Also include:
- An engaging opening hook or bell-ringer activity (first 3–5 minutes)
- A closing activity that requires students to demonstrate the lesson objective (last 5 minutes)
- At least one activity that requires students to do something at the Apply level or higher on Bloom's Taxonomy

Write student-facing directions in clear, concise language appropriate for [grade level].
```

Review the activities. Check that they match the cognitive demand of your objectives and that the student directions are clear enough to use as-is.

## Step 4: Build the Assessment Plan

Now generate the formative and summative assessment elements for the lesson.

```
For the lesson plan we have been building, now design the assessment components.

Create the following:
1. Entry assessment (first 3 minutes): A quick check of prerequisite knowledge students need for today's lesson. Format: [e.g., 2 multiple choice questions on a slide / brief written prompt / verbal poll]

2. Formative checks during the lesson: For each major activity, specify:
   - What the teacher looks/listens for to gauge understanding
   - A specific question or prompt to check comprehension
   - What to do if most students are struggling (re-teach strategy)
   - What to do if most students demonstrate quick mastery (extension)

3. Exit ticket (last 5 minutes): Design an exit ticket that directly assesses whether students met the lesson objectives. Include:
   - The exact questions or prompts (2–3 items)
   - What a proficient response looks like
   - What a response that needs follow-up looks like

4. Success criteria: Write 3–4 "I can" statements that students can use to self-assess their learning at the end of the lesson.

All assessments must align directly to the stated learning objectives — do not assess anything not taught in the lesson.
```

Review the assessment components. Verify that every learning objective has at least one associated assessment point.

## Step 5: Add Differentiation

Finally, layer in differentiation supports so the lesson works for all learners. Reference the strategies from the [Differentiated Instruction](/lesson-planning/differentiated-instruction) page.

```
For the complete lesson plan we have built, now add differentiation and accommodation supports.

Address the following:

1. Content differentiation:
   - How will you provide access to the content for students reading below grade level?
   - What enrichment content is available for advanced students?
   - What visual or multimedia supports will you include?

2. Process differentiation:
   - Describe scaffolded versions of the main activity (high support, moderate support, independent)
   - What graphic organizers, sentence starters, or word banks will you provide?
   - How will you group students strategically?

3. Product differentiation:
   - What options will students have for demonstrating their learning?
   - How will you ensure all options meet the same assessment criteria?

4. Specific accommodations:
   - English learners: [number] students at [proficiency level] — provide specific language supports
   - Students with IEPs: [describe relevant accommodations, e.g., extended time, preferential seating, modified output]
   - Students who finish early: Provide a meaningful extension activity, not busy work

5. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) features:
   - Multiple means of engagement (how you motivate and hook students)
   - Multiple means of representation (how you present content)
   - Multiple means of action and expression (how students show what they know)

Format the differentiation notes so they can be added directly to the lesson plan as a reference section.
```

Review the differentiation layer. Ensure accommodations are specific and actionable, not generic.

## After Generating Your Lesson Plan

Once you have worked through all five steps:

1. **Compile the outputs** — Combine the AI-generated content into a single document, editing for consistency and flow.
2. **Review against your objectives** — Verify that every learning objective is explicitly taught, practiced, and assessed.
3. **Adapt for your students** — Adjust examples, vocabulary, and pacing based on what you know about your specific class.
4. **Prepare materials** — Create or gather any handouts, slides, graphic organizers, or resources referenced in the plan.
5. **Plan for contingencies** — Identify one or two places where you can cut or extend if time runs short or long.
6. **Teach and reflect** — After teaching the lesson, note what worked and what to adjust for next time.

<Callout type="success" title="Iterate and improve">
The best lesson plans get better with use. After you teach a lesson, return to the AI with specific feedback: "The collaborative activity took 20 minutes instead of 12. The exit ticket was too easy. Revise the plan accordingly." This iterative approach builds a library of refined, tested lesson plans over time.
