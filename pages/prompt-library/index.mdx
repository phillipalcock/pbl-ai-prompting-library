## Compatibility

These prompts work with any major AI assistant, including:

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Gemini** (Google)
- **Copilot** (Microsoft)

The prompts use plain language and do not depend on any tool-specific features. You may get slightly different output styles across tools, but the results will be comparable.

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific** in your bracketed fields. "Grade 8 ELA" produces better results than "middle school."
- **Iterate.** If the first output is not quite right, ask the AI to revise a specific section rather than starting over.
- **Combine prompts.** Use the standards prompts first, then feed those outputs into lesson planning or assessment prompts.
- **Add context.** Append details about your students, school, or curriculum to any prompt for more tailored results.
