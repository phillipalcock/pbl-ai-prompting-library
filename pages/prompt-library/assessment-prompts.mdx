# Assessment & Rubric Prompts

Prompts for creating rubrics, generating questions at specific depth-of-knowledge levels, designing performance tasks, and building formative assessments.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
For best results, start with clear learning objectives. If you need help writing those first, use the Standards Unpacking Prompts.

## 1. Generate a Rubric from Learning Objectives

Use this to create a complete rubric with performance-level descriptors tied directly to your objectives.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="orange" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a rubric for the following assessment.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Assessment Type: [e.g., essay, presentation, project, lab report]
Learning Objectives:
- [objective 1]
- [objective 2]
- [objective 3]

Rubric Requirements:
- Performance levels: Exceeds (4), Meets (3), Approaching (2), Beginning (1)
- One criterion row per learning objective
- Descriptors should describe observable student performance
- Avoid vague language like "excellent," "good," or "poor"
- Each descriptor should make clear what the student did, not what they failed to do

Format as a table with columns: Criterion | Exceeds (4) | Meets (3) | Approaching (2) | Beginning (1).
```
</Card>

## 2. Create Multiple-Choice Questions at Specified DOK Levels

Use this to generate assessment items at a target Depth of Knowledge level.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="orange" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Generate multiple-choice questions for the following topic and DOK level.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Topic: [specific topic]
Learning Objective: [objective]
DOK Level: [1 = Recall, 2 = Skill/Concept, 3 = Strategic Thinking, 4 = Extended Thinking]
Number of Questions: [e.g., 5]

For each question:
1. Write the question stem clearly and concisely
2. Provide 4 answer choices (A-D)
3. Mark the correct answer
4. Write a brief rationale explaining why the correct answer is right and why each distractor is wrong
5. Confirm the question matches the requested DOK level

Avoid "all of the above" and "none of the above" as answer choices. Each distractor should represent a common misconception or error.
```
</Card>

## 3. Write Short-Answer and Extended-Response Questions

Use this for constructed-response items that require students to explain their thinking.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="orange" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Write constructed-response assessment questions for the following.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Topic: [specific topic]
Learning Objectives:
- [objective 1]
- [objective 2]

Generate:
1. Two short-answer questions (2-3 sentence responses expected)
2. One extended-response question (paragraph or multi-paragraph response expected)

For each question, provide:
- The question as students would see it
- The point value
- A sample exemplary response
- Key elements the response must include to earn full credit
- Common errors or misconceptions to watch for when grading

Write questions in student-friendly language appropriate for [grade level].
```
</Card>

## 4. Design a Performance Task Assessment

Use this to create an authentic assessment where students demonstrate learning through a real-world task.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="orange" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Design a performance task assessment for the following unit.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Unit Topic: [topic]
Learning Objectives Being Assessed:
- [objective 1]
- [objective 2]
- [objective 3]
Time Available: [e.g., 2 class periods]

The performance task should:
1. Present a realistic scenario or problem
2. Require students to apply multiple skills and knowledge areas
3. Result in a tangible product or presentation
4. Be completable within the time available

Provide:
- The task description as students would see it (including the scenario, requirements, and deliverable)
- A checklist of required components
- A 4-level rubric (Exceeds / Meets / Approaching / Beginning) with 3-4 criteria
- Suggested materials and resources students may use
```
</Card>

## 5. Create a Formative Assessment Check-In

Use this to build a quick mid-lesson or mid-unit check that informs your next instructional steps.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="orange" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a formative assessment check-in for the following lesson.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Learning Objective: [objective]
Point in the Lesson: [e.g., after direct instruction, midway through practice, end of day 2 of a 5-day unit]
Time Available: [e.g., 3-5 minutes]

Provide three different formative check-in options:
1. A quick written check (e.g., 1-2 questions on paper or a whiteboard response)
2. A verbal or movement-based check (e.g., think-pair-share, four corners, thumbs up/down)
3. A digital-friendly check (e.g., poll question, short online response)

For each option, include:
- The exact prompt or question students see
- How to interpret student responses (what indicates mastery vs. confusion)
- Suggested teacher action based on results (reteach, move on, or small group support)
```
</Card>

## 6. Generate Rubric Descriptors for Specific Criteria

Use this when you already have rubric criteria but need well-written descriptors for each performance level.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="orange" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Write performance-level descriptors for the following rubric criteria.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Assessment Type: [e.g., research paper, science lab, oral presentation]
Performance Levels: [e.g., Exceeds (4), Meets (3), Approaching (2), Beginning (1)]

Criteria to describe:
1. [criterion 1, e.g., "Use of Evidence"]
2. [criterion 2, e.g., "Organization and Structure"]
3. [criterion 3, e.g., "Content Accuracy"]
4. [criterion 4, e.g., "Communication Clarity"]

For each criterion and level, write a 1-2 sentence descriptor that:
- Describes what the student does at that level (not what they fail to do)
- Uses specific, observable language
- Clearly distinguishes each level from the ones above and below it
- Avoids counting language (e.g., "3 out of 4 sources") in favor of quality language

Format as a table with criteria as rows and performance levels as columns.
```
