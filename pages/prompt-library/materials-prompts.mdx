# Student Materials Prompts

Prompts for creating worksheets, graphic organizers, study guides, student-facing instructions, vocabulary sheets, and reading comprehension handouts.

<Callout type="info" title="Formatting Note">
These prompts generate text-based content. For materials that need specific visual layouts (tables, graphic organizers), you may need to reformat the AI output in a document editor or design tool.

## 1. Create a Student Worksheet for a Specific Lesson

Use this to generate a structured worksheet that reinforces the lesson's key skills and concepts.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="violet" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a student worksheet for the following lesson.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Lesson Topic: [topic]

The worksheet should include:
1. A clear title and student name/date line
2. Brief directions written in student-friendly language
3. A mix of question types:
   - 2-3 recall or identification questions
   - 2-3 application or analysis questions
   - 1 open-ended question requiring explanation or justification
4. Adequate space between questions for student responses (indicate "[space for response]")
5. A bonus or challenge question for early finishers

Also provide a separate answer key with expected responses for each question.

## 2. Generate a Graphic Organizer for a Topic

Use this to create a structured visual framework students can fill in to organize their thinking.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="violet" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Design a graphic organizer for the following learning activity.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Topic: [topic]
Purpose: [e.g., compare and contrast, cause and effect, sequence events, categorize information, brainstorm ideas]
Learning Objective: [objective]

Provide:
1. The type of graphic organizer best suited for this purpose (e.g., Venn diagram, T-chart, flow chart, web, matrix)
2. A description of the organizer layout with labeled sections
3. The exact headings, labels, and column/row names to use
4. 1-2 completed example entries to model expectations
5. Student-facing instructions (2-3 sentences) explaining how to fill it in
6. A text-based representation of the organizer structure that can be recreated in a document editor
```
</Card>

## 3. Create a Study Guide from Lesson Content

Use this to produce a student-friendly review document covering a unit or set of lessons.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="violet" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a study guide for students preparing for an assessment.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Unit or Topic: [unit/topic name]
Key Learning Objectives:
- [objective 1]
- [objective 2]
- [objective 3]
- [objective 4]
Assessment Format: [e.g., multiple choice, short answer, essay, mixed]

The study guide should include:
1. A summary of key concepts (1-2 paragraphs per objective, written at student reading level)
2. Key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions
3. Important formulas, rules, or processes (if applicable)
4. 2-3 practice questions per objective with answers on a separate section at the end
5. Study tips specific to the assessment format
6. A self-check checklist: "I can..." statements matching each objective

Write everything in clear, student-facing language appropriate for [grade level].
```
</Card>

## 4. Write Student-Facing Instructions for an Activity

Use this when you need clear, step-by-step directions that students can follow independently.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="violet" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Write student-facing instructions for the following activity.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Activity Title: [title]
Activity Description: [brief description of what students will do]
Time Available: [e.g., 30 minutes]
Grouping: [individual / pairs / small groups of ___]
Materials Needed: [list materials]

The instructions should:
1. Be written in second person ("You will...")
2. Use numbered steps in sequential order
3. Include specific details (not "discuss with your group" but "share your answer with your group and write down one thing you agreed on")
4. Note time benchmarks (e.g., "You should finish steps 1-3 in about 10 minutes")
5. Describe the expected final product or deliverable
6. Include a "What to do if you finish early" section

Write at a reading level appropriate for [grade level]. Keep sentences short and direct.
```
</Card>

## 5. Design a Vocabulary Practice Sheet

Use this to create an engaging vocabulary activity that goes beyond simple definitions.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="violet" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a vocabulary practice sheet for the following terms.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Topic: [topic]
Vocabulary Words:
1. [word 1]
2. [word 2]
3. [word 3]
4. [word 4]
5. [word 5]
[add more as needed]

The practice sheet should include these sections:
1. **Definitions** — Student-friendly definitions for each word (not dictionary definitions)
2. **Context Sentences** — One example sentence per word showing the word used correctly in context related to [topic]
3. **Matching Activity** — Scrambled definitions for students to match to the correct word
4. **Fill-in-the-Blank** — 5 sentences with blanks where students choose the correct vocabulary word
5. **Use It** — 2 prompts where students write their own sentences using at least 2 vocabulary words each

Provide an answer key for the matching and fill-in-the-blank sections.
```
</Card>

## 6. Create a Reading Comprehension Handout

Use this to build a guided reading activity with pre-, during-, and post-reading tasks.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="violet" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a reading comprehension handout for the following text.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Text Title: [title of the reading]
Text Topic: [brief description of what the text is about]
Reading Level: [approximate Lexile or grade-level equivalent]
Learning Objective: [what students should understand or be able to do after reading]

The handout should include:

**Pre-Reading (before students read):**
- 2 activation questions to surface prior knowledge
- 3-5 key vocabulary words with brief definitions

**During Reading (while students read):**
- 3-4 guided questions tied to specific sections or paragraphs (indicate where in the text each applies)
- A place for students to note unfamiliar words or confusing passages

**Post-Reading (after students finish):**
- 2 comprehension questions (one factual, one inferential)
- 1 analysis or evaluation question requiring a written response with text evidence
- A brief summarization task (e.g., "In 2-3 sentences, explain the main idea and one supporting detail")

Write all questions and instructions in student-friendly language.
```
