# Standards Unpacking Prompts

Prompts for breaking down curriculum standards into teachable components, generating aligned objectives, and creating mapping documents.

<Callout type="info" title="Before You Start">
Have your specific standard text ready to paste. The more precise your standard language, the better the output.

## 1. Unpack a Standard into Knowledge and Skills

Use this when you need to identify exactly what students must know and be able to do for a given standard.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="blue" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
I need to unpack the following curriculum standard into its component parts.

Standard: [paste the full text of the standard]
Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]

Please identify:
1. The discrete knowledge components (facts, concepts, vocabulary) students must learn
2. The skills students must demonstrate
3. The cognitive demand level (recall, application, analysis, synthesis)
4. Any prerequisite knowledge or skills implied but not stated
5. Key academic vocabulary within the standard

Format the output as a structured table with columns for Component, Type (Knowledge/Skill), and Cognitive Level.
```

## 2. Generate Learning Objectives from Standards

Use this to turn a standard into specific, measurable learning objectives you can use in lesson plans.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="blue" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Generate specific, measurable learning objectives from the following standard.

Standard: [paste the full text of the standard]
Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Number of objectives needed: [3-6 recommended]

Requirements for each objective:
- Begin with a measurable verb (avoid "understand" or "learn")
- Include a clear condition (given what?)
- Include a performance criterion (how well?)
- Be specific enough to assess in a single lesson or activity

Format each objective as: "Students will be able to [verb] [what] [condition] [criterion]."
```
</Card>

## 3. Align Objectives to Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

Use this when you want to ensure your objectives span a range of cognitive complexity.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="blue" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
I have the following learning objectives for a [subject] unit at the [grade level] level. Please align each one to a Bloom's Taxonomy level and suggest revisions to improve coverage across levels.

Objectives:
[paste your list of objectives, one per line]

For each objective:
1. Identify the current Bloom's level (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
2. Explain why it maps to that level
3. If the set is missing a level, suggest a new or revised objective to fill the gap

Also provide a summary showing the distribution of objectives across all six Bloom's levels.
```
</Card>

## 4. Cross-Reference Objectives Across Multiple Standards

Use this when planning a unit that addresses several standards and you need to see where objectives overlap or connect.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="blue" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
I am planning a [subject] unit for [grade level] that must address multiple standards. Please cross-reference these standards and identify overlapping and complementary objectives.

Standards:
1. [paste standard 1]
2. [paste standard 2]
3. [paste standard 3]
[add more as needed]

For each standard, list the key objectives. Then create a cross-reference matrix showing:
- Which objectives are shared across standards
- Which objectives are unique to a single standard
- Suggested combined objectives that address multiple standards simultaneously
- A recommended teaching sequence that builds logically from foundational to complex objectives
```
</Card>

## 5. Create a Standards-to-Objectives Mapping Document

Use this to produce a complete alignment document for a unit or course, suitable for curriculum documentation.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="blue" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a comprehensive standards-to-objectives mapping document for the following unit.

Unit Title: [unit title]
Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Unit Duration: [number of weeks or lessons]

Standards Addressed:
[paste all relevant standards with their codes]

For each standard, generate:
1. 2-4 measurable learning objectives
2. Suggested assessment type for each objective (formative or summative)
3. The Bloom's Taxonomy level of each objective
4. The lesson or week where the objective is primarily taught

Format the output as a table with columns: Standard Code | Objective | Assessment Type | Bloom's Level | Lesson/Week.

End with a summary noting any standards that may need additional coverage or objectives that serve double duty.
```
