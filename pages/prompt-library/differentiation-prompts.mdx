# Differentiation Prompts

Prompts for adapting materials across reading levels, creating scaffolded versions, generating sentence frames, designing extensions, and supporting English learners and students with specific learning needs.

<Callout type="info" title="Important">
Always review AI-generated differentiated materials for accuracy and appropriateness. Differentiation is highly context-dependent -- you know your students best.

## 1. Adapt Materials to a Different Reading Level

Use this to take existing content and adjust its complexity up or down while preserving the core ideas.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="red" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Adapt the following text to a different reading level while preserving the key content and concepts.

Original Text:
[paste the original text here]

Current Reading Level: [e.g., Grade 8, Lexile 1000]
Target Reading Level: [e.g., Grade 5, Lexile 700]
Subject: [subject area]

When adapting, please:
1. Simplify or elevate sentence structure as needed for the target level
2. Replace vocabulary with grade-appropriate alternatives (list any swaps made)
3. Keep all essential content, facts, and concepts intact
4. Maintain the same organizational structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
5. Adjust the length if needed (lower levels may need shorter paragraphs; higher levels can handle more detail)
6. Preserve any discipline-specific vocabulary that students must learn, but add brief in-text definitions

Provide the adapted text and a brief note listing the key changes you made.
```

## 2. Create Scaffolded Versions (High / Medium / Low Support)

Use this to produce three versions of the same activity with varying levels of support built in.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="red" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create three scaffolded versions of the following activity, each with a different level of support.

Activity Description: [describe the activity]
Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Learning Objective: [objective]

Create these three versions:

**Version A — High Support:**
- Sentence starters or frames for all responses
- Word banks provided
- Partially completed examples
- Fewer questions or steps
- Simplified language

**Version B — Medium Support:**
- Sentence starters for some responses
- Key vocabulary defined in a sidebar
- One worked example
- Standard number of questions or steps

**Version C — Low Support (Independent):**
- No sentence starters
- No word banks
- No worked examples
- Full number of questions or steps
- Open-ended response options

All three versions must assess the same learning objective. Label each version clearly. A teacher should be able to print and distribute the appropriate version to each student.
```
</Card>

## 3. Generate Sentence Starters and Frames

Use this to create language supports that help students structure their academic responses.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="red" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Generate sentence starters and sentence frames for the following academic task.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Task: [describe what students are writing or discussing, e.g., "writing a paragraph comparing two historical events" or "explaining their solution to a math problem"]
Learning Objective: [objective]

Provide:

1. **Sentence Starters** (5-6) — Open-ended beginnings that students complete in their own words.
   Example format: "One important difference between ___ and ___ is..."

2. **Sentence Frames** (5-6) — More structured templates with multiple blanks that guide the complete response.
   Example format: "The author uses ___ to show that ___, which suggests ___."

3. **Discussion Stems** (4-5) — Phrases for academic conversation (agreeing, disagreeing, building on ideas, asking for clarification).
   Example format: "I agree with ___ because..."

4. **Transition Phrases** (4-5) — Words or phrases to connect ideas in writing.
   Example format: "In contrast," "As a result," "This is significant because"

Organize all items by purpose. Write at a level appropriate for [grade level].
```
</Card>

## 4. Create Extension Activities for Advanced Learners

Use this to design rigorous enrichment tasks that deepen understanding without simply adding more work.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="red" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Design extension activities for advanced learners who have mastered the core objective.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Core Learning Objective: [objective]
Lesson or Unit Topic: [topic]
Time Available for Extension: [e.g., 15 minutes, one class period]

Create 3 extension options that:
- Deepen understanding rather than simply adding volume
- Require higher-order thinking (analysis, evaluation, or creation)
- Are self-directed and do not require significant additional teacher instruction
- Connect to the same topic but push beyond the grade-level standard
- Are engaging and feel like opportunities, not punishments for finishing early

For each option, provide:
1. Activity title
2. Brief description (2-3 sentences)
3. Student-facing instructions
4. Expected product or deliverable
5. The higher-order thinking skill targeted (e.g., Bloom's level)
```
</Card>

## 5. Adapt Materials for English Learners

Use this to modify existing materials with language supports appropriate for different English proficiency levels.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="red" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Adapt the following material for English learners at the specified proficiency level.

Original Material:
[paste the original text, questions, or activity]

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
English Proficiency Level: [Entering / Emerging / Developing / Expanding / Bridging]
Student's Home Language (if known): [language, or "varies"]

Adaptations should include:
1. Simplified sentence structures (shorter sentences, active voice, reduced clause complexity)
2. Key vocabulary highlighted and defined with student-friendly explanations
3. Visual supports described (suggest where images, diagrams, or icons would help)
4. Sentence frames or starters for any written or verbal responses
5. Cognates identified (if home language is specified)
6. Cultural context explained where background knowledge may differ
7. Directions rewritten in clear, step-by-step format with numbered steps

Provide the fully adapted material ready for student use, plus a brief teacher note explaining the key modifications made.
```
</Card>

## 6. Generate Accommodations for Specific Learning Needs

Use this to create targeted modifications for students with specific accommodations or learning profiles.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="red" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Suggest accommodations for the following assignment based on the student learning need described.

Assignment Description:
[describe the assignment]

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Learning Objective: [objective]
Student Learning Need: [e.g., dyslexia, ADHD, processing speed deficit, visual impairment, fine motor challenges, anxiety around timed tasks]

Provide:
1. **Presentation Accommodations** — How to modify how information is presented to the student (e.g., font size, read-aloud, chunking)
2. **Response Accommodations** — How to modify how the student demonstrates learning (e.g., oral response, typed instead of handwritten, reduced quantity)
3. **Setting Accommodations** — Environmental changes that may help (e.g., preferential seating, reduced distractions, separate space)
4. **Timing Accommodations** — Adjustments to pacing or deadlines (e.g., extended time, breaks, chunked deadlines)
5. **Modified Version** — Provide a modified version of the assignment that maintains the same learning objective and rigor while incorporating the accommodations above

Ensure that all accommodations maintain access to the grade-level learning objective. The goal is equal access, not reduced expectations.
