## 1. Generate a Complete Lesson Plan from Objectives

Use this when you have clear objectives and need a fully structured lesson plan.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="green" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a complete lesson plan using the following details.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Lesson Duration: [e.g., 50 minutes]
Learning Objectives:
- [objective 1]
- [objective 2]
- [objective 3, if applicable]

Include these sections:
1. **Warm-Up / Do Now** (5 minutes) — An engaging opener that activates prior knowledge
2. **Direct Instruction** (10-15 minutes) — Key content delivery with teacher modeling
3. **Guided Practice** (10-15 minutes) — Structured activity where students practice with support
4. **Independent Practice** (10-15 minutes) — Activity where students apply learning on their own
5. **Closure / Exit Ticket** (5 minutes) — Quick check for understanding tied to the objectives
6. **Materials Needed** — List all required materials
7. **Differentiation Notes** — Brief suggestions for supporting struggling and advanced learners

Use clear, teacher-friendly language. Include specific examples, sample questions, and anticipated student responses where appropriate.

## 2. Create a Unit Sequence from Standards

Use this to map out a multi-lesson unit with a logical progression of skills and content.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="green" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Design a unit sequence for the following unit.

Unit Title: [unit title]
Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Number of Lessons: [e.g., 10-12]
Lesson Duration: [e.g., 50 minutes each]

Standards Addressed:
[paste standards]

For each lesson in the sequence, provide:
1. Lesson title
2. Primary learning objective(s)
3. Key activities (1-2 sentences)
4. Assessment checkpoint (formative or summative)

Organize the sequence so that:
- Earlier lessons build foundational knowledge and skills
- Middle lessons develop application and analysis
- Later lessons require synthesis and evaluation
- The final lesson is a summative assessment or culminating task

Present the sequence as a numbered list with the information above for each lesson.
```
</Card>

## 3. Design a Warm-Up / Bell-Ringer Activity

Use this to create a quick, focused opening activity that connects to the lesson.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="green" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a 5-minute warm-up activity for the following lesson.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Today's Lesson Topic: [topic]
Prior Knowledge Students Should Have: [what they learned previously]
Today's Learning Objective: [objective]

The warm-up should:
- Be completable in 5 minutes or less
- Activate prior knowledge related to today's topic
- Require minimal materials (paper/pencil or verbal response)
- Be engaging and accessible to all students
- Serve as a bridge from previous learning to today's content

Provide the warm-up prompt exactly as students would see it, plus brief teacher notes on expected responses and how to transition into the lesson.
```
</Card>

## 4. Create Guided Practice Activities

Use this when you need a structured activity where students practice new skills with support.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="green" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Design a guided practice activity for the following lesson.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Learning Objective: [objective]
Skill Being Practiced: [specific skill]
Time Available: [e.g., 15 minutes]
Grouping: [individual / pairs / small groups]

The activity should:
1. Begin with a teacher-modeled example (I Do)
2. Include a collaborative step (We Do)
3. Transition to supported independent work (You Do with help)
4. Include 3-5 practice problems or tasks of increasing difficulty
5. Provide checkpoints where the teacher can assess understanding before moving on

Write the activity with step-by-step teacher instructions. Include the exact problems or tasks students will complete and sample correct responses.
```
</Card>

## 5. Design a Lesson Closure / Exit Ticket

Use this to create a quick end-of-lesson check that directly measures the objective.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="green" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Create a lesson closure and exit ticket for the following lesson.

Subject: [subject area]
Grade Level: [grade level]
Learning Objective: [objective]
Key Vocabulary Covered: [list key terms]
Time Available: [e.g., 5 minutes]

Provide:
1. A brief closure activity (2 minutes) — such as a think-pair-share, summary sentence, or quick review question that helps students consolidate learning
2. An exit ticket (3 minutes) with 1-3 questions that directly assess whether students met the objective
3. A scoring guide or key for the exit ticket
4. Suggested next steps: what to do if most students succeed vs. if many students struggle
```
</Card>

## 6. Adapt a Lesson for a Different Grade Level or Format

Use this to take an existing lesson and rework it for a different context.

<Card shadow="sm" padding="lg" radius="md" withBorder my="md">
<Badge color="green" mb="sm">Copy and Fill In</Badge>

```
Adapt the following lesson for a different context.

Original Lesson Summary:
[describe or paste the lesson plan]

Original Grade Level: [grade level]
Original Format: [e.g., in-person, 50-minute class]

Adapt To:
- New Grade Level: [target grade level]
- New Format: [e.g., virtual/hybrid, block schedule, 30-minute class, small group intervention]

When adapting, please:
1. Adjust reading level and vocabulary complexity
2. Modify activity length and pacing for the new format
3. Revise examples to be age-appropriate
4. Adjust expectations for independent work vs. teacher support
5. Note any materials or technology changes needed
6. Keep the core learning objective intact, but rewrite it for the new grade level if needed

Provide the full adapted lesson plan using the same structure as the original.
