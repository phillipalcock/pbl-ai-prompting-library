## Work With PBL Future Labs

I'm **Phillip Alcock**, and through **PBL Future Labs** I work directly with educators, schools, and organisations to build capacity in AI-assisted curriculum design and project-based learning.

### What I Offer

**1:1 Coaching for Educators**
Personalised support to help you integrate AI tools into your curriculum design workflow. Whether you're just getting started or looking to refine your approach, I'll help you build confidence and efficiency.

**School & Team Workshops**
Interactive, hands-on workshops for teaching teams, departments, or whole-school professional development. Sessions are tailored to your context, standards, and goals.

**Curriculum Design Consulting**
Need help building or redesigning units, courses, or programmes with AI-assisted workflows? I work alongside teams to co-design high-quality, standards-aligned project-based learning experiences.

### How I Work

- **Practical & hands-on** — Every session involves building real materials you can use immediately
- **Context-specific** — I tailor everything to your standards, subjects, and student needs
- **AI-integrated** — I help you learn how to use AI tools effectively and responsibly in your design process
- **PBL-focused** — Grounded in project-based learning principles that put students at the centre
