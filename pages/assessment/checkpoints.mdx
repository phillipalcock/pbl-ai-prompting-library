# Checkpoints

Checkpoints are structured moments in the project where students demonstrate progress and receive feedback.

## Purpose

Checkpoints serve three functions:

1. **Accountability** — Students show evidence of work at regular intervals
2. **Feedback** — Teachers and peers provide input before the final product
3. **Course correction** — Teams can adjust their approach based on feedback

## Checkpoint Schedule Template

| Checkpoint | Timing | Students Submit | Feedback From |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1: Research | End of Week 1 | Source annotations, initial findings | Teacher |
| 2: Analysis | Mid Week 2 | Data analysis draft, preliminary conclusions | Peer team |
| 3: Draft | End of Week 2 | First draft of final product | Teacher + Peer |
| 4: Revision | Mid Week 3 | Revised product with change log | Self-assessment |
| 5: Final | End of Week 3 | Completed product + reflection | Panel/Audience |

## Designing Effective Checkpoints

Each checkpoint should:

- Require a concrete deliverable (not just "be working on it")
- Connect to specific learning goals
- Include a clear feedback mechanism
- Allow time for revision before the next checkpoint
