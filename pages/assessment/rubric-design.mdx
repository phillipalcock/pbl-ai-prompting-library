# Rubric Design

A PBL rubric assesses the learning goals — not just the final product. Each criterion should trace back to a specific objective.

## Rubric Structure

For each learning goal, define:

- **Criterion** — What is being assessed
- **Exceeds** — What exceptional performance looks like
- **Meets** — What proficient performance looks like
- **Approaching** — What developing performance looks like
- **Beginning** — What initial-stage performance looks like

## Example Criterion

**Learning Goal:** Students will analyze water quality data to identify contamination patterns (Tier 2).

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Exceeds | Accurately analyzes all data sources, identifies patterns, and proposes explanations supported by evidence |
| Meets | Accurately analyzes most data sources and identifies major patterns |
| Approaching | Analyzes some data but misses key patterns or makes errors in interpretation |
| Beginning | Attempts analysis but does not identify meaningful patterns |

## AI Prompt for Rubric Generation

```
Create a 4-level rubric for the following PBL learning goal:
[paste learning goal]

Use these levels: Exceeds, Meets, Approaching, Beginning.
Each level should describe observable student performance.
Avoid subjective language like "excellent" or "poor."
Focus on what the student does, not what they don't do.
```
