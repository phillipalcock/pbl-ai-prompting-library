# Assessment

This module covers how to design assessments that align to your learning objectives and provide meaningful feedback throughout the instructional process.

## What You'll Learn

- Designing formative assessments that monitor student progress and inform instruction
- Building summative assessments that measure mastery of learning objectives
- Creating rubrics that clearly define performance expectations
- Using AI to generate, refine, and align assessment items to standards

## Assessment Design Principles

Effective assessment begins with clarity about what students should know and be able to do. Every assessment — whether a quick exit ticket or a culminating project — should connect directly to your stated learning objectives.

### Alignment

Assessments should match the cognitive demand of the objective. If your objective asks students to *analyze*, your assessment should require analysis — not recall.

### Balance

A well-designed assessment plan uses both formative and summative strategies. Formative assessments provide ongoing feedback that shapes instruction. Summative assessments measure what students have learned at the end of a unit or course.

### Transparency

Students perform better when they know what success looks like. Share rubrics, exemplars, and criteria before students begin working — not after.
