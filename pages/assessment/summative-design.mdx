# Summative Assessment Design

Summative assessments measure what students have learned at the end of an instructional unit, course, or program. They answer the question: *Did students meet the learning objectives?*

<Callout type="info" title="Design principle">
Start with the learning objectives, not the assessment format. The objectives determine what you measure; the format is simply the vehicle for measurement.

## Backward Design for Assessments

Effective summative assessments are designed before instruction begins. This backward design approach ensures alignment between what you teach and what you assess.

<Accordion variant="separated" my="md">
  <Accordion.Item value="step-1">
    <Accordion.Control>Step 1: Identify desired results</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Start with your learning objectives and standards. What should students know and be able to do by the end of the unit? List the specific, measurable outcomes you expect.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="step-2">
    <Accordion.Control>Step 2: Determine acceptable evidence</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>What would convince you that students have met each objective? Define the types of evidence you need — this becomes your assessment. Consider whether you need selected-response items, constructed-response items, or performance tasks.</Text>

    <Accordion.Control>Step 4: Review for alignment</Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>
      <Text>Map every assessment item back to a specific objective. If an item does not clearly connect to an objective, revise or remove it. If an objective has no corresponding item, add one. This alignment check is essential.</Text>
    </Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>

## Aligning Assessments to Standards and Objectives

Every summative assessment item should map to a specific standard or objective. Use an alignment table to verify coverage:

<Table striped highlightOnHover withTableBorder withColumnBorders my="md">
  <Table.Thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>Objective</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>DOK Level</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Assessment Item(s)</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Format</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Thead>
  <Table.Tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Explain causes of the Civil War</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>DOK 2</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Items 1-3</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Multiple choice</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Analyze primary source documents</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>DOK 3</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Items 4-5</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Short answer</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>Evaluate competing historical interpretations</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>DOK 4</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Item 6</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Extended response essay</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
  </Table.Tbody>
</Table>

## AI Prompts for Summative Assessment Design

### Generate an Assessment Framework

```
I am designing a summative assessment for a [grade level] [subject] unit on [topic].

The learning objectives are:
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
3. [Objective 3]

For each objective, recommend:
- The best assessment format (selected-response, constructed-response, or performance task)
- The appropriate Depth of Knowledge level
- A brief description of what the item or task should ask students to do

Ensure the overall assessment covers all objectives and includes a mix of question types.
```

### Design a Performance Task

```
Create a performance task for [grade level] students that assesses the following objective:
[paste objective]

The task should:
- Present a realistic scenario or problem
- Require students to apply their learning to a new context
- Include clear directions and constraints
- Be completable in [time frame]
- Include a scoring rubric with 4 performance levels

Format the task as it would appear on a student handout.
```

### Build an Assessment Blueprint

```
Create an assessment blueprint for a [number]-question [subject] unit test.

Standards to assess:
[list standards]

For each standard, specify:
- Number of items
- Item format (multiple choice, short answer, extended response)
- DOK level
- Point value

Ensure the blueprint balances coverage across all standards
and includes items at multiple DOK levels.
```
