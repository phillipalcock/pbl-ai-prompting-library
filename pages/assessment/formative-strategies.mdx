# Formative Assessment Strategies

Formative assessment happens continuously throughout instruction — not just at the end of a unit. It provides real-time data that teachers use to adjust instruction and students use to monitor their own learning.

## Daily Strategies

### Exit Tickets

2-3 questions targeting the day's learning goal. Copy this prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI tool:

```
You are an experienced teacher. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Generate 3 exit ticket questions that:
- Target the core concept of this standard
- Progress from recall → application → transfer
- Can be answered in 2-3 minutes each
- Use age-appropriate language for [grade level] students

For each question, note what student understanding it reveals and what a strong vs. struggling response looks like.
```

### Process Journals

Students document decisions, struggles, and next steps. Copy this prompt into any AI tool:

```
You are a teacher designing a process journal prompt. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Create a structured journal prompt that asks students to:
1. Describe what they worked on today related to this standard
2. Identify one specific decision they made and why
3. Name one struggle or confusion they encountered
4. Set a concrete next step for tomorrow

Include sentence starters appropriate for [grade level] students and a brief rubric for assessing journal quality.
```

### Stand-Up Meetings

5-minute team check-ins on progress and blockers. Copy this prompt into any AI tool:

```
You are a teacher facilitating student team stand-up meetings. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Create a structured 5-minute stand-up meeting protocol for [grade level] student teams that includes:
- 3 specific check-in questions tied to this standard (not generic status updates)
- A simple recording template teams can fill out during the meeting
- Guidance on what the teacher should listen for during team check-ins
- Red flags that indicate a team needs intervention
- A brief follow-up action teams should complete after the stand-up
```

### Skill Checks

Quick demonstrations of specific skills being developed. Copy this prompt into any AI tool:

```
You are a teacher. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Design a 5-minute skill check that:
- Isolates one specific skill from this standard
- Requires students to demonstrate (not just recall) the skill
- Includes clear success criteria students can self-assess against
- Works for quick teacher observation during class

Provide the task, success criteria checklist, and a quick recording sheet for the teacher. Use language appropriate for [grade level] students.
```

## Assessing Collaboration

Collaboration is a cross-cutting skill that requires its own assessment approach:

| What to Observe | Evidence |
|----------------|----------|
| Role fulfillment | Team logs showing task completion |
| Communication | Meeting notes, message threads |
| Conflict resolution | Documented disagreements and resolutions |
| Shared workload | Individual contribution tracking |

Copy this prompt to generate a collaboration assessment tool:

```
You are a teacher assessing collaboration. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Create a collaboration assessment tool that:
- Connects teamwork behaviors to progress on this standard
- Includes observable indicators for: role fulfillment, communication, shared workload, and conflict resolution
- Uses a simple rating scale appropriate for [grade level]
- Can be used by both teachers (observation) and students (self/peer)

Provide the rubric/checklist and a brief observation recording sheet.
```

## Self and Peer Assessment

Students assess their own and their teammates' contributions using structured protocols:

1. **Individual reflection** — What did I contribute? What would I do differently?
2. **Peer feedback** — Specific observations about teammates' contributions
3. **Team assessment** — How well did the team function as a unit?

Use consistent criteria so students know what's expected from the start.

### Self-Reflection Prompt

```
You are a teacher. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Create a self-reflection protocol that asks students to:
- Rate their understanding on a specific scale (with descriptors)
- Provide evidence of their learning from today's work
- Identify what they would do differently
- Connect their learning to the bigger goal of this standard

Use language and reflection depth appropriate for [grade level] students. Include a completed example.
```

### Peer Feedback Prompt

```
You are a teacher designing a peer feedback protocol. Based on this curriculum standard or learning goal:

"[Paste your curriculum standard or learning goal here]"

Create a structured peer feedback form that:
- Focuses on observable evidence related to this standard
- Uses "I noticed..." and "I wonder..." sentence frames
- Includes 3-4 specific criteria drawn from the standard
- Is appropriate for [grade level] students

Include the feedback form, instructions for students, and norms for giving/receiving feedback.
```
